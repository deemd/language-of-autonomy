      "interest in deploying agentic AI solutions within the next three years, according to\n",
      "BCG’s most recent IT Buyer Pulse Check, and software companies’ public filings\n",
      "are mentioning agentic AI 12 times more today compared to a year ago. This trend\n",
      "is further underscored by the fact that the largest enterprise software vendors are\n",
      "treating agentic AI as a strategic priority, as evidenced by recent product launches\n",
      "and strategic acquisitions to support their agentic AI ambitions.\n",
