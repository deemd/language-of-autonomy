      "The emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) marks a pivotal moment in technology,\n",
      "promising to reshape industries and redefine how businesses operate and create value. For\n",
      "Google Cloud partners, this represents not just a new technological wave but a profound\n",
      "opportunity to lead customers into a more intelligent, automated, and productive future. This\n",
      "report is intended for executive leaders within IT service organizations, providing actionable\n",
      "insights and a strategic framework to guide the development of an agentic AI strategy for\n",
      "2025 and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The findings and perspectives shared within these pages are the culmination of rigorous,\n",
      "bottom-up analysis, where we examined the industries, roles, and tasks that stand to most\n",
      "benefit from agentic AI. This quantitative research was supplemented by findings from indepth interviews with Google Cloud’s own leaders and IT service partners at the forefront\n",
      "of AI development. These conversations covered topics such as sources of customer\n",
      "demand, emergent use cases, adoption barriers, and the opportunities for service partners\n",
      "to evolve their commercial approach. This mix of data-driven analysis and real-world market\n",
      "commentary yielded a focused and actionable view of agentic AI opportunities that will\n",
      "emerge going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This report shows that agentic AI opens up two significant layers of opportunity—it elevates\n",
      "the value of traditional implementation engagements, and for partners ready to broaden\n",
      "their remit, it creates a clear runway to evolve into broader transformation partners. This\n",
      "report will show how partners can deepen customer relationships by helping them solve\n",
      "their most fundamental business challenges, alleviate long-standing industry pain points, and\n",
      "unlock new, sustainable revenue streams. We believe that by understanding the landscape,\n",
      "identifying high-potential use cases, and developing targeted capabilities, partners can\n",
      "achieve remarkable growth and differentiation.\n",

      "###### **Executive summary**\n",
      "\n",
      "Agentic AI represents a critical leap forward in AI advancement, offering novel\n",
      "capabilities to tackle deeply entrenched industry pain points that enterprises have\n",
      "faced for years. This wave of innovation is not just about improving productivity—\n",
      "agents will enable a fundamental reimagination of enterprise workflows, making\n",
      "businesses faster, more adaptive, and better attuned to customer needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In an ‘agentic world,’ AI agents will therefore unlock value in nearly every industry\n",
      "and workflow—whether it is streamlining error-prone claims adjudication in\n",
      "Insurance, proactively managing inventory misalignments in Industrials, delivering\n",
      "hyper-personalized experiences at scale in Retail, or accelerating analytical\n",
      "processes during pharmaceutical drug discovery. As a result, agentic AI can\n",
      "structurally redefine how enterprises generate value and compete.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Enterprises are already seeing the transformative potential of agentic AI, with\n",
      "several proof points quickly emerging. Today, more than 90% of enterprises report\n",
      "interest in deploying agentic AI solutions within the next three years, according to\n",
      "BCG’s most recent IT Buyer Pulse Check, and software companies’ public filings\n",
      "are mentioning agentic AI 12 times more today compared to a year ago. This trend\n",
      "is further underscored by the fact that the largest enterprise software vendors are\n",
      "treating agentic AI as a strategic priority, as evidenced by recent product launches\n",
      "and strategic acquisitions to support their agentic AI ambitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this context, the Partner Ecosystem has an immense opportunity to help\n",
      "enterprises realize the value that agents can bring. In total, agentic AI represents\n",
      "a potential ~$1T market opportunity for agentic AI services globally, with $350B to\n",
      "$450B in the U.S. alone—a figure that surpasses the estimated $320B U.S. spend\n",
      "on traditional services today—and if agentic AI follows a similar trajectory to\n",
      "cloud computing, we expect $300B to $600B of the global services opportunity\n",
      "to be realized by 2035-2040, though likely a conservative timeline given the\n",
      "current momentum and pace of adoption. Within this landscape, distinct value\n",
      "pools are fast emerging where partners can deliver outsized impact through\n",
