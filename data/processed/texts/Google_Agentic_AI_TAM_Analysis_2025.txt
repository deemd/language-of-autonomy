For Google Cloud partners, this represents not just a new technological wave but a profound opportunity to lead customers into a more intelligent, automated, and productive future. This report is intended for executive leaders within IT service organizations, providing actionable insights and a strategic framework to guide the development of an agentic AI strategy for 2025 and beyond. The findings and perspectives shared within these pages are the culmination of rigorous, bottom-up analysis, where we examined the industries, roles, and tasks that stand to most benefit from agentic AI. This quantitative research was supplemented by findings from in- depth interviews with Google Cloud’s own leaders and IT service partners at the forefront of AI development. These conversations covered topics such as sources of customer demand, emergent use cases, adoption barriers, and the opportunities for service partners to evolve their commercial approach. This mix of data-driven analysis and real-world market commentary yielded a focused and actionable view of agentic AI opportunities that will emerge going forward. This report shows that agentic AI opens up two significant layers of opportunity—it elevates the value of traditional implementation engagements, and for partners ready to broaden their remit, it creates a clear runway to evolve into broader transformation partners. This report will show how partners can deepen customer relationships by helping them solve their most fundamental business challenges, alleviate long-standing industry pain points, and unlock new, sustainable revenue streams. We believe that by understanding the landscape, identifying high-potential use cases, and developing targeted capabilities, partners can achieve remarkable growth and differentiation. Consider this report a comprehensive guide to navigating the exciting and dynamic world of agentic AI. Our goal is to spotlight the emerging demand signals for agentic AI and guide partners towards the pain points that will drive the most value for customers across industries. Kevin Ichhpurani President, Global Partner Ecosystem & Channels, Google Cloud SShhaappinign gth eth fuet ufureture 33 Executive summary Agentic AI represents a critical leap forward in AI advancement, offering novel capabilities to tackle deeply entrenched industry pain points that enterprises have faced for years. This wave of innovation is not just about improving productivity— agents will enable a fundamental reimagination of enterprise workflows, making businesses faster, more adaptive, and better attuned to customer needs. In an ‘agentic world,’ AI agents will therefore unlock value in nearly every industry and workflow—whether it is streamlining error-prone claims adjudication in Insurance, proactively managing inventory misalignments in Industrials, delivering hyper-personalized experiences at scale in Retail, or accelerating analytical processes during pharmaceutical drug discovery. As a result, agentic AI can structurally redefine how enterprises generate value and compete. Enterprises are already seeing the transformative potential of agentic AI, with several proof points quickly emerging. Today, more than 90% of enterprises report interest in deploying agentic AI solutions within the next three years, according to BCG’s most recent IT Buyer Pulse Check, and software companies’ public filings are mentioning agentic AI 12 times more today compared to a year ago. This trend is further underscored by the fact that the largest enterprise software vendors are treating agentic AI as a strategic priority, as evidenced by recent product launches and strategic acquisitions to support their agentic AI ambitions. Given this context, the Partner Ecosystem has an immense opportunity to help enterprises realize the value that agents can bring. In total, agentic AI represents a potential ~$1T market opportunity for agentic AI services globally, with $350B to $450B in the U.S. alone—a figure that surpasses the estimated $320B U.S. spend on traditional services today—and if agentic AI follows a similar trajectory to cloud computing, we expect $300B to $600B of the global services opportunity to be realized by 2035-2040, though likely a conservative timeline given the current momentum and pace of adoption. Within this landscape, distinct value pools are fast emerging where partners can deliver outsized impact through agentic AI deployment. Therefore, partners must act quickly to capture the significant opportunity ahead. Shaping the future 4 Partners must also embrace their increasingly important role as long- The future of term partners to enterprises, driving initiatives that closely align with agentic AI will be ‘top-of-the-house’ business objectives. To that end, more onus will be placed on them to fundamentally redesign traditional business shaped by those processes around agents, and as agentic deployments scale, partners who lead; partners will be expected to deliver new forms of ongoing support, including agentic fleet orchestration or agent evaluation/measurement. This who act decisively evolution in responsibility will open up new opportunities for partners now will not just to explore alternative monetization models, including transaction- based, outcome-based, and SaaS-like recurring fee structures. participate in this As a continued signal of a partner-first approach, Google Cloud evolution—they will equip partners with resources to capitalize on this opportunity, will define the providing differentiated market intelligence, access to our enterprise customer base, and a robust ecosystem of cutting-edge agentic category. tools. To that end, Google has already introduced a number of capabilities enabling the partner ecosystem to jump-start the agentic AI transformation journey for customers. At the beginning of the journey, customers lack awareness and want to see value early. Partners can run discovery workshops with Google in the room to help their customers evaluate agent use cases, as well as quickly create agent prototypes for pitches using Vertex AI and its family of cutting-edge multi-modal Gemini models. During the build stage, many enterprises worry if their data pipeline is sufficiently ready. Partners can use BigQuery’s AI tools and modern connectors across systems to quickly activate agents with less structured data than needed previously. Finally, as agentic solutions scale, driving user adoption in a productive and sustainable manner is key. Partners can help establish the right change management and agent lifecycle habits for their clients, leveraging training and domain expertise available within the Google Cloud ecosystem. These resources serve as a powerful starting point, further enhanced by industry-leading AI research from DeepMind, world- class TPU infrastructure, and a strong commitment to open-source collaboration through initiatives like the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This holistic approach, combined with co-innovation programs and partner support, is designed to fuel your success. 5 Shaping the future 55 01 Understanding agentic AI: The next frontier SShhaappinign gth eth fuet ufureture 66 Agentic AI unlocks the scripts and often struggled when they were faced with changes or unexpected conditions. full power of AI Separately, the rise of generative AI (gen AI) introduced a powerful tool for unstructured, Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence creative tasks.

An agent can then Shaping the future 7 orchestrate the full, end-to-end resolution, from autonomously processing a wider scope of claims to initiating payment, significantly improving straight- through processing rates and freeing up specialists for high-judgment work. Alternatively, consider personalization in marketing. Gen AI excels at creating personalized content elements (e.g., unique emails and ad call-to-actions or even distinct AI-rendered images to suit individual preferences). However, gen AI struggles to orchestrate entire individual customer journeys or dynamically adapt in real-time without marketing teams manually defining intricate journey rules and campaign parameters. Agentic AI can harness gen AI capabilities to autonomously manage hyper-personalization. It builds and refines individual profiles from online patterns, purchases data, and customer-provided data, uses gen AI for unique “N-of-1” content creation, and crucially, determines the optimal timing, sequence, and channels for interactions across the full journey. This enables truly adaptive, optimized marketing experiences at scale. Examples like these abound, and they will continue to proliferate as agentic capabilities improve, allowing enterprises to fundamentally reimagine their business processes.

In Retail, these pain points include rising input costs that threaten margin or large-scale customer service inefficiencies. In Healthcare, it’s staffing shortages in clinics or persistent issues in patient billing. In Financial Services, it’s error-prone and delayed insurance claims and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, driving cost leakage and elevated compliance risks. The exhibit below crystallizes that several of these macro pain points exist, and that each industry faces its own unique concoction of these challenges. Role of agents: Industries have grappled with long-standing pain points that have hindered enterprises from maximizing growth and productivity potential Examples of key industry pain points Non-exhaustive Financial Services/ Healthcare/ Tech/TMEG Auto/Industrial Public Sector Retail/CPG Insurance Life Sciences Slow content creation Delayed, error-prone claims Disruptive equipment Delays in benefit delivery Chronic staffing shortages Inefficient customer service Manual content creation reduces Manual processes and siloed data failures Eligibility checks require Shortages of medical, nursing, and Support often inconsistent/delayed speed to market, personalization slow processing in insurance claims Maintenance is reactive, issues fragmented data & manual review admin. staff create delays and care and causes churn identified post-failure coordination gaps Media content misuse Risky, manual KYC checks Inadequate safety oversight Permit delays stall activity Error-prone billing/claims Disjointed cust. experience Limited rights oversight drives Inconsistent identity reviews cause Reactive safety monitoring Requires coordination across teams Manual billing processes lead to Evolving customer expectations compliance & revenue gaps compliance risk increases incident risk and manual validation denials, delays, admin burden and fragmented experiences reduces loyalty and revenue Prolonged service outages Slow, fragmented reporting Suboptimal load planning Delayed policy response Slow, error-prone diagnoses Rising cost of inputs Manual triage of telco network Data fragmentation drives slow, Static truckload & route plans miss Agencies lack capacity to analyze, Manual diagnostics prone to delays Prices not optimized to protect events delays resolution error-prone compliance consolidation opportunities act on new legislation and inconsistency revenue under cost pressure Slow creation of narratives Generic wealth advice Inventory misalignment Limited fraud oversight Manual R&D slows discovery Misaligned/unsold inventory Player immersion limited with few Static advice misses client needs Manual allocation decisions lag Fragmented data and manual Documentation-heavy R&D slows Product inventory fluctuates branching narratives without personalization real-time needs review delay detection drug discovery frequently and unpredictably Unoptimized pricing yield Slow loan underwriting Unpredictable lead sourcing Slow dissemination of info Inefficiencies in clinical trials Slow personalized marketing Fixed prices inflexible to real-time Fragmented data slows approvals Sourcing leads in B2B requires high Urgent public updates slowed by Slow site startup delays High cost and slow turnaround for demand/availability and limits access effort, with unclear ROI manual communication workflows clinical trials highly personalized marketing Note: Based on interviews with partners and Google industry solution leaders; Source: Partner and Google interviews, BCG analysis Exhibit 2.1: Many long-standing pain points exist across industries To address these pain points, enterprises can now use a constellation of agents that are tailored to industry-specific and business-specific needs. In Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG), an inventory planning AI agent could continuously forecast demand using live structured and unstructured data, and then autonomously orchestrate responses like triggering replenishment, rerouting shipments, or adjusting warehouse throughput requirements in real-time to prevent disruptions. In Healthcare, a care coordination agent can dynamically orchestrate personalized care plans, ensuring patient follow-ups are scheduled, Shaping the future 10 Role of agents: But in our ‘new world,’ AI agents can solve these pain points to unlock transformational value pools across industries Agentic solutions to key industry pain points Cross-industry use cases Non-exhaustive Financial Services/ Healthcare/ Tech/TMEG Auto/Industrial Public Sector Retail/CPG Insurance Life Sciences Marketing/personalization Claims adjudication agent Predictive maint. agent Benefits processing agent Care coordination agent Customer serv./ agent Automates claims validation, fraud Predicts equipment failures, Verifies eligibility and approves Coordinates full patient journey returns agent Generates personalized content checks, and payouts triggers maintenance tasks benefits across systems incl. care plans, readmission, etc. Resolves service issues and from analyzing audience behavior processes refunds/returns Rights compliance agent KYC verification agent Safety compliance agent Permitting & licensing agent Rev. cycle mgmt. agent Customer experience agent Monitors content usage, flags Verifies identity and flags risks for Monitors safety data and initiates Validates applications, auto-issues Automates key revenue cycle tasks Recommends personalized offers, violations, flags to legal team onboarding risk response licenses and permits – validates claims, manages support across customer journey submission, denials, and follow-ups Network operations agent Reporting/compliance agent Logistics optimization agent Legislative analysis agent Medical diagnostics agent Pricing analyst agent Detects and resolves outages by Prepares and submits Plans truck loads and routes Identifies impact of new legislation, Analyzes data/imaging to generate Optimizes prices based on market analyzing telemetry data, etc. regulatory reports alongside supply chain agent routes to departments diagnostic suggestions trends and demands Narrative design agent Wealth advisor agent Inventory allocation agent Fraud detection agent Drug discovery R&D agent Inventory planning agent Generates branching storylines, Generates tailored financial plans + Rebalances stock across sites Monitors transactions, etc., to Finds targets and molecules from Forecasts demand and triggers dialogue trees, character arcs monitors portfolios using demand/supply signals detect and act on potential fraud scientific data replenishment Dynamic pricing agent Loans underwriter agent B2B sales agent Communications agent Clinical trial ops agent Marketing campaign agent Adjusts pricing based on demand, Assesses borrow risk and Sources leads based on sales goals Drafts messages, routes to approval Onboards sites and enrolls Generates and publishes creatives, time, capacity, etc. issues approvals and propensity to buy teams, publishes eligible patients refines according to performance Note: Based on interviews with partners and Google industry solution leaders; Source: Partner and Google interviews, BCG analysis Exhibit 2.2: Agentic AI solutions can solve long-standing pain points across all industries executed, and adapted based on incoming doing so, agents will enable human workers to patient data, alleviating pressure from chronic shift their focus from routine execution to higher- staffing shortages.

As such, this model quantifies the potential for agentic AI across approximately 330 task categories. Building from this foundation of addressable tasks, we then estimate the associated application layer market based on the value delivered to enterprises and, crucially, the associated SI services opportunity across industries. Please see the appendix for a detailed view of our methodology. The potential timing for adoption While the value pools discussed earlier outline a long-run ‘full potential’ value (expressed in 2025 dollars), we recognize that the actual trajectory and timeframes for realizing this potential are subject to considerable uncertainty. The evolution of the cloud market provides a relevant—albeit imperfect—analog for how the agentic AI market may play out, having also represented a structural technology shift for enterprises. Forrester, IDC, and Gartner suggest cloud spend has grown from ~$20B in 2010 to >$400B in real terms, growing at ~25% p.a. over a timeframe of ~15 years, and even faster at 30% p.a. between 2010 and 2015. Across 10-15 years, cloud revenues scaled from <$20B to >$400B, with fastest growth during early stages but sustained high growth Estimated Global Public Cloud revenues in 2010 real value1 (2010-2024, $), triangulated using Forrester, IDC, Gartner $500B Cloud infra & platform services (IaaS & PaaS) Greater number of cloud/hybrid environments, however high revenue growth sustained due to Cloud applications (SaaS) substantial size of opportunity, of similar $400B magnitude to agentic AI $300B Early stages to cloud adoption Even in nascent stages, cloud revenues scales from a <$20B $200B to $80-100B in ~5Y time Illustrative view of where agentic AI1 current sits on $100B the cloud adoption curve $0B 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 YoY real growth 30% 37% 34% 21% 22% 13% 16% Exhibit 3.3: Historical growth in cloud revenue While estimates on current agentic spend are unclear, Gartner1 estimates generative AI software spend to be ~$19B in 2024. In all likelihood, true agentic software spend today is lower than this, given its recency, but will see a swift acceleration to this baseline given its current infancy against the substantial enterprise traction. Shaping the future 15 As a base case, if you believe that the agentic market today can unfold at the same rate that cloud did from between 2010 and 2024, $300B to $600B (in 2025 dollars) of our total ~$1T agentic services value pool estimate is achievable by 2035-2040. While this bracket is not a true point forecast, it does signal the magnitude of opportunity agentic AI brings, matching, if not exceeding, the current total U.S. SI services spend within 10 to 15 years of adoption. This was the quarter of Agentforce… we have never seen products grow at these levels… in just a few months, we have seen this addressable market go to hundreds of billions of dollars.” Salesforce CEO, Q4FY25 Earnings Conference Call When cloud started, adoption took longer due to the size of transformation and upskilling needed. This infrastructure is already in place for agentic and has been fast-tracked by COVID.” Google Cloud Partner Additionally, the speed of AI momentum seen in the market suggests agentic adoption could follow a faster timeline than cloud, further pulling forward the timeline for partners and giving good reason to be optimistic that substantial value is at play for partners within the next 3 to 5 years. For instance, Stripe found that AI startups are building businesses faster. The top 100 AI companies on Stripe in 2024 took 24 months to $5 ARR vs. 37 months for previous waves of SaaS companies.2 Shaping the future 16 Regional market dynamics Many of our current The characteristics and make-up of the agentic opportunities are in North AI market vary by region due to differences in industry exposure and the mix of service-based vs. America, where new tech manufacturing-based economies. adoption seems to start first.

This creates a natural fit for SIs to support operationally intensive industries, especially those with distributed workforces and manual frontline processes. There are relatively high levels of data readiness and executive ambition across key JAPAC markets, particularly in Australia. Many retailers in Australia are actively exploring how AI can drive unified customer interactions and improve responsiveness across channels at scale. LATAM: The LATAM SI value pool is smaller and is driven by more of a mixed labor base, with the types of roles being more diverse than other regions (~40% of the potential SI value pool is driven by augmentation of tasks performed by managers or professionals; with another ~40% by technicians or clerical and sales workers). LATAM has a higher concentration of value in the Retail/CPG, Public Sector, and Auto/Industrial verticals (~60%). 1: Gartner: “Gartner Forecasts Worldwide GenAI Spending to Reach $644 Billion in 2025” 2: Stripe Annual Letter, 2024 (compared to Top 100 SaaS companies in 2018) Shaping the future 18 04 The strategic imperative for partners: How services will evolve in an agentic world SShhaappinign gth eth fuet ufureture 1199 The sheer scale of the agentic AI opportunity makes it a strategic imperative for SIs to reshape how they deliver, monetize, and differentiate. A potential ~$1T opportunity for agentic AI services is more than just a new service line—it reinforces the urgency for SIs to undertake a strategic rethink, act fast, and capture the opportunity ahead. Observing from the sidelines leaves untapped value on the table. To navigate this transition successfully, there are five key themes that SIs must consider when defining their strategic roadmap in the agentic era. Evolving the SI delivery model beyond just technical execution In the traditional world, SIs helped customers solve large-scale, execution questions like “how can enterprises migrate on-prem SAP to the cloud?”. However, in the agentic world, customer expectations of SIs will evolve towards helping them leverage agents to solve fundamental business issues. This requires SIs to more deeply understand and potentially redesign business processes to realize the value of agents. This evolution has implications for how SIs deliver work over time: • Greater emphasis on upfront design work in the near term: SIs need to invest time upfront to understand business processes, and potentially design new organization processes that embed agents into workflows in order to realize full value potential. • More prototypes—not slides: Customers will increasingly expect ‘prototypes that work’ early on, which will cause SIs to shift from delivering slides to delivering working code—in turn, this will enable SIs to show value early, which strengthens their long-term positioning. • Finding the change leader to help drive implementation: While technical implementation remains a key element, SIs over time will need to become more savvy in helping customers drive adoption as agents move into production environments. Crucially, this includes proactive change management: identifying change leaders, outlining adoption roadmaps, and managing production deployment risks. SIs may take this opportunity to build the capability to do this work themselves or work hand-in-hand with other consulting partners. • Evolution in maintenance support needs: While core maintenance capabilities will remain relevant, we expect incorporation of new agent-specific elements that have never been seen before, such as orchestrating multi-agent workflows, evaluating and measuring agent performance, and refreshing agent knowledge to prevent model drift—all performed over time on a recurring basis. Shaping the future 20 Based on traction in the last 6 months, we fear clients will only use agents to enhance current workflows, not reimagine them.

This opportunity is a unique juncture to refresh pricing strategies, enabled by the step-change in both the magnitude of opportunity that agentic AI brings and the shift in work mix and knowledge base it requires. While we believe that traditional ‘time and material’ and ‘fixed fee’ models will continue as key structures for predictable, transparent pricing, SIs should use this opportunity to consider other monetization options that align with value delivery to customers: • Recurring software/SaaS-like pricing: SIs may be able to embody their unique domain expertise into productized agentic solutions. If SIs are able to resell their agentic solution as reusable IP— potentially discoverable and accessible via marketplace—a recurring, SaaS-like monetization can drive customer stickiness and waves of additional value. • Non-recurring, transaction-based (e.g., one-time fee per agent deployed): This model allows clients to purchase specific AI capabilities or ‘digital workers’ on demand for discrete tasks, offering cost control for well-defined, non-continuous needs, distinct from ongoing service subscriptions. • Outcome-based pricing: Agents can inherently drive measurable business outcomes when deployed end-to-end. For such scenarios, SIs should consider outcome-based pricing when a feasible ROI exists with the risk upside vs. risk balance. Sis must weigh monetization innovation (i.e., outcome-based and recurring models) and solution repeatability against customers’ appetite for predictable, transparent pricing Illustrative & non-exhaustive 01 Outcome-based 02 Recurring software/ Saas-like pricing e.g., per agent, per interaction/per use Complexity and risk of delivery for SI Exhibit 4.2: Various monetization models exist based on the SI’s risk appetite Using new tools to quickly reach sufficient data readiness for agentic deployment Addressing how data is supplied to agentic AI is a foundational conversation with every customer, though the traditional concept of ‘data readiness’ is evolving. The emphasis is shifting towards architecting effective data pipelines that enable AI agents to reliably access and process the diverse information that they need, when they need it. Thankfully, new gen AI-enabled tools have been built to address these needs, allowing SIs to quickly build knowledge maps and assemble data repositories that can be used to guide agents. Increasingly, these repositories can include unstructured data (e.g., documents, email, transcripts), which was often a challenge to integrate with traditional automation approaches. As a result, SIs must be equipped to use these tools so that they can help customers map their existing data landscape, allowing them to efficiently and securely connect various datasets to AI agents. This includes mapping operational data flows, understanding AI/data regulations (which may differ by industry and geography), and pinpointing key data sources such as databases, APIs, and document repositories that can be used to guide the behavior of agents that rely on them. Once these data pathways are better understood, SIs can guide clients across a spectrum of solutions. For immediate pilots/POCs, leveraging readily accessible client data, external data (e.g., from Google’s Kaggle), or even synthetic data, can offer tactical value and help quickly validate ROI. Modern approaches, including the use of advanced connectors (like the Model Context Protocol, MCP) and inter-agent communication protocols (like the Agent2Agent Protocol, A2A), can enable faster and more seamless data access from various enterprise systems. Furthermore, agentic systems themselves are designed to improve over time in their decision-making capabilities as they process more information. While robust data governance, regulatory adherence, and data quality assurance remain important for building sustainable and scalable agentic AI solutions, the initial barrier to entry can be lowered by focusing on smart data pipeline design and gen AI’s ability to work with the data landscape as-is. Educating customers on these evolving data integration patterns and prerequisites will be vital. Shaping the future 23 Building the capabilities to scale agentic solutions from pilot to production SIs will increasingly need to demonstrate core capabilities to map out existing business processes in their pre-agent state, redesign these workflows to incorporate agents (with or without humans in the loop), utilize best-in-class enterprise AI platforms such as Vertex AI to develop agents, as well as set up integrations with existing data systems that are required to execute that workflow. Balancing efficiency optimization and broader regulatory considerations is crucial in this redesign process and can be moderated by defining clear human-agent interaction points. SIs investing in proprietary knowledge, reusable IP (such as pre-built connectors to widely used existing enterprise software, custom model approaches, and design patterns), and strong change management capabilities will be able to accelerate the POC to deployment conversion cycle and create a long-term competitive advantage. Furthermore, the ability to deploy these integrated solutions into production at scale is critical. This requires establishing processes that enable continuous integrations suitable for the pace of agentic AI evolution, rigorous testing methodologies to ensure agent reliability, and sound infrastructure planning. In the near-term, this means arming go-to-market (GTM) teams with tools to educate and provide assurance to customers, for instance, a library of vertical use cases, a set of ethical and AI regulation- compliant deployment guidances (which may differ by industry and geography), and ROI calculators with flexible pricing and prototypes/demos to bring to pitches. Over time, customers will also need support in implementing observability tools to monitor agent accuracy, efficiency, and ROI attribution, as well as emerging agentic maintenance work such as refreshing agent knowledge to prevent model drift for continued improvement in tangible value delivered. Shaping the future 24 Focusing on high-value, industry-specific and customer-specific use cases to drive differentiation Agentic AI’s applicability is vast, requiring SIs to prioritize use cases based on opportunity size and ease of deployment. While we extensively discuss the ‘art of the possible’ for each industry in the next chapter, SIs should consider two distinct horizons: pursuing quick wins with a clear near-term fit for agents (e.g., customer service), and building towards larger, transformative agentic ecosystems (e.g., N-of- 1 personalization). This will enable SIs to build brand and capability for agentic services while building reusable IP and delivering increasing value for customers. Exhibit 4.3: Critical to relentlessly prioritize agents that deliver value, focusing on quick wins to start Google Cloud is dedicated to helping SIs answer these strategic imperatives and is committed to ensuring SIs have the right tools and ecosystem to address these key questions and foster innovation and success in the agentic era. How SIs can best leverage Google Cloud to expedite agentic AI deployment is further explored in Chapter 6. Partners proactively addressing these themes can empower their customers to use AI agents in driving new avenues of growth and efficiency, as well as build a true competitive advantage for themselves to tap into the unprecedented agentic AI market opportunity.

Shaping the future 28 In the near term, we have observed particular excitement around content marketing and personalization, where enterprises are testing new approaches. Today, marketing teams rely on a patchwork of tools and manual coordination to create, personalize, and deploy content across channels. Crafting copy, selecting visuals, segmenting audiences, and measuring campaign performance all require frequent handoffs and back-and-forth revisions, slowing down time to launch and limiting personalization. An agentic approach can change that, helping unlock significant value within marketing, a segment driving roughly ~12% of the total U.S. SI value pool within Tech/TMEG (Exhibit 5.1). A content marketing agent can ingest campaign briefs, generate multi-format content personalized to different audience segments, and deploy assets across Content Management Systems (CMS) and ad platforms. It can continuously monitor performance, run A/B tests, and refine messaging in real time, closing the loop between strategy and execution. For media and entertainment brands managing complex, multi-channel campaigns, this unlocks a new operating model, one where teams can deliver highly personalized content with speed, precision, and consistency. Instead of working in cycles, marketing becomes a continuous, adaptive system—driving faster launches, increased audience engagement, and greater return on creative investment.

Engineering teams can use network operations agents to monitor telemetry data, detect anomalies, pinpoint root causes, and trigger resolution workflows, dramatically reducing service outages and minimizing downtime. Finance professionals can also explore use cases like dynamic pricing agents, which evaluate demand and usage to adapt pricing models in Shaping the future 29 real time, or revenue leakage prevention agents that detect billing anomalies and initiate recovery actions. These are just a few examples of how agents can address long-standing challenges across networks. Network operations, in particular, offer a compelling and exciting near-term opportunity for transformation given their complexity, urgency, and direct impact on service reliability. Today, service outages, latency issues, and equipment failures can require manual monitoring and triage across complex telemetry and incident systems, often delaying resolution and hurting customer experience. A network operations agent can ingest live telemetry data, detect anomalies, identify root causes, and coordinate resolution steps across systems and teams. Instead of waiting for failures to be reported and escalated, an agent can proactively manage outages and performance degradation, reducing time to resolution and improving overall reliability. This level of autonomy transforms network management from a reactive, manual process into a proactive, intelligence-driven system, reducing downtime, improving service reliability, and allowing engineering teams to focus on long-term optimization rather than day-to-day triage.

Narrative teams can use storyline generation agents to develop branching plots and character arcs tailored to individual player decisions. Meanwhile, game testing agents can simulate gameplay to uncover bugs earlier in the development cycle. On the business side, finance teams might deploy offer optimization agents to test and adapt in-game bundles based on player behavior. These examples highlight the breadth of ways agentic AI can support gaming studios across storytelling, quality assurance, and engagement. Shaping the future 30 An area that we see as exciting and compelling in the near term is narrative design and personalization, where agentic AI can unlock creative scale and storytelling flexibility. Today, creating branching storylines and dialogue options can be a manual, time- consuming process that relies heavily on narrative designers and writers anticipating every player’s choice. As games grow more open-ended and player-driven, this model struggles to scale, limiting both personalization and replayability. Writers must manually script divergent arcs, build dialogue trees, and ensure consistency across story branches, often requiring repeated review and iteration. An agentic approach enables faster generation and dynamic adaptation of game narratives. A narrative design agent can define story scaffolds based on genre and gameplay objectives, generate branching plotlines and character arcs, and write dynamic dialogue tailored to player choices and emotional tone. These agents can also adjust narrative flow in real time based on player decisions and simulate story paths to identify pacing gaps or logic breaks. By automating the development and refinement of narrative components, agentic AI allows creative teams to focus on deeper storytelling, enabling more immersive, personalized player experiences at scale, while also reducing the manual lift required to bring those experiences to life.

Established applications include engineering teams relying on code generation agents to turn functional requirements into production-ready code, supported by test automation agents that create and execute QA test suites. DevOps agents can also be used to manage build pipelines, detect integration issues, and accelerate deployment. These examples illustrate how agentic AI can remove friction across the software development lifecycle, enabling Shaping the future 31 teams to release higher-quality software faster, with fewer bottlenecks. For SIs, these solutions are a core unlock within engineering, a segment directionally driving more than 50% of the total U.S. SI services value pool in Tech/TMEG (Exhibit 5.1). Many of these use cases, while especially relevant in Tech, also extend across other industries. For example, DevOps automation agents are increasingly relevant in Retail or Financial Services for managing complex infrastructure that powers customer-facing applications. Similarly, code generation and test automation agents are equally valuable for healthcare companies building digital experiences or public sector teams modernizing legacy systems. These cross-cutting agents offer SIs a powerful entry point to drive repeatable, scalable impact, not only in traditional software companies, but in any enterprise looking to improve how technology is developed and deployed. Taken together, these use cases show how agentic AI can enable a step-change in how Tech/TMEG organizations operate. By embedding reasoning and autonomy directly into execution workflows, agents are helping teams move beyond traditional tooling to deliver accelerated software development cycles, more resilient infrastructure, and hyper-personalized user experiences. For SIs, this represents a rare inflection point—an opportunity to re-architect core digital processes and help clients realize new levels of speed, scale, and adaptability across their businesses. Shaping the future 32 Retail/CPG Retail and CPG companies face growing pressure to personalize the customer experience without compromising profitability. At the same time, they must navigate rising input costs, supply chain disruptions, and volatile demand. Many groups are still managing inventory, service, and promotions through static rules and disconnected systems.

Complex or ambiguous cases are escalated as needed, while the bulk of requests are resolved quickly and consistently. For SIs, solutions like this, alongside sales rep agents, are critical to tap into the large sales value pool within Retail/CPG, roughly driving ~47% of the total U.S. SI services value pool in Retail/CPG (Exhibit 5.5). Retail/CPG: Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) In CPG, agentic AI can help streamline supply chain execution and reduce operational inefficiencies. Inventory planning agents can forecast demand, monitor stock levels, and trigger replenishment to maintain optimal inventory across distribution networks. Procurement agents can evaluate pricing, assess vendor options, and initiate reorders to manage cost volatility and ensure continuity of supply. Meanwhile, vendor onboarding agents can automate partner setup by validating documentation, syncing systems, and coordinating tasks across internal teams. These applications show how agents can enhance agility, reduce manual workload, and improve throughput across the CPG value chain. In the near term, inventory planning stands out as a particularly promising area for agentic transformation. Despite its central role in operational execution, it remains a manual and error-prone function in many CPG organizations. Planners often contend with incomplete demand signals, batch-based data updates, and fragmented coordination with procurement teams. This results in familiar tradeoffs: excess inventory that ties up working capital, or stockouts that lead to lost sales and diminished service levels. An inventory planning agent can ingest real-time sales, promotion, and supply data to forecast demand and trigger replenishment actions automatically. It continuously monitors product availability and adjusts orders based on current conditions, improving sell-through and reducing capital tied up in misaligned inventory. Over time, this enables CPG brands to align supply with demand more precisely, even as buying patterns shift. For SIs, an inventory planning agent is a key value driver for their customers’ operations functions, a segment broadly accounting for ~8% of the total US SI services value pool within Retail/CPG.

In Retail, agents unlock new levels of responsiveness and personalization, transforming how brands engage shoppers across touchpoints. In CPG, agents bring precision and agility to supply chain decisions, enabling organizations to react in real time to demand signals, cost pressures, and disruptions. Across both segments, these solutions not only reduce operational burden but also enable faster, smarter execution, helping companies grow customer loyalty, improve margins, and compete more effectively in a market defined by speed and constant change. Shaping the future 36 Financial Services/Insurance Financial Services and Insurance firms have invested heavily in digital infrastructure, yet they remain burdened by fragmented processes, legacy systems, and complex regulatory obligations. Some core workflows, such as claims processing, onboarding, and wealth advisory, can still depend on static rules, duplicated data, and high-touch manual review. While newer entrants such as neo-banks often have a head start—built on modern, cloud-native architectures and more unified data systems—traditional institutions are also making steady progress in modernizing their tech stacks and consolidating data environments. This evolving foundation positions both types of firms to benefit from agentic AI, though their starting points may differ. SI services value pool in Financial Services/Insurance ($) ~$125-175B ~$60-90B Admin 5% In the finance job family, examples of tasks include: Engineer 22% • Evaluating customer documents and validating accuracy of data NorthAM 57% • Analyzing risk using data (e.g., fraud signals) • Authorizing claims / payment transactions • Providing financial guidance based on customer needs Finance 61% EMEA 21% Primarily driven by roles such as: • Claims specialist • Billing specialist • Financial advisor JAPAC 19% Marketing 3% Operations 2% • Financial analyst Sales 7% LATAM Scientist 2% 0% Global FinServ/Insurance US FinServ/Insurance Exhibit 5.8: Regional split of global agentic AI value pool in Financial Services/ Insurance and role mix in high-impact SI opportunities Shaping the future 37 Agentic AI presents a $125B to $175B global opportunity for SI services in the Financial Services and Insurance sector, including $60B to $90B in the U.S. Within this, the largest value pools are likely to emerge in the ‘Finance’ segment, driving roughly ~61% of the U.S. SI services value pool in Financial Services/Insurance. Key areas of focus within this segment include: • Underwriting support in Insurance: Empowering underwriters with tools that synthesize applicant, policy, and risk data to generate individualized risk profiles, flag edge cases, and streamline decision-making • Personalized financial planning in Wealth Management: Supporting wealth managers with tools to generate tailored investment strategies, monitor portfolios, and adapt plans based on client data • Know Your Customer (KYC) verification in Banking: Enabling compliance and onboarding teams to gather and verify identity documents, screen against watchlists, flag risk indicators, and auto-complete KYC workflows to reduce onboarding friction and compliance burden In addition to finance-specific workflows, many high-value agentic use cases span engineering roles such as software developers, business analysts, and data analysts. Agents that support tasks like code generation, report creation, and workflow optimization are especially relevant for Financial Services/Insurance institutions looking to modernize internal systems, enhance analytical throughput, and scale regulatory reporting. These capabilities are also broadly applicable across industries such as Tech/TMEG and Healthcare/Life Sciences, enabling reusable agent patterns that drive cross-sector impact. By transforming these high-friction workflows, agentic AI helps Financial Services and Insurance organizations increase accuracy, reduce compliance risk, and deliver faster, more responsive customer experiences. It enables institutions to move beyond rigid, manual processes toward adaptive systems that learn and improve over time, enhancing decision quality, accelerating time-to-value, and allowing teams to focus on higher-impact work. Financial Services/Insurance: Insurance In Insurance, agentic AI can streamline action-heavy workflows across claims, underwriting, and intake operations. Underwriting teams can deploy underwriting support agents to synthesize applicant, policy, and risk data, generate individualized risk profiles, and flag edge cases for human review, accelerating data gathering and improving consistency. Upstream in the process, submission triage agents can sort and prioritize incoming forms based on urgency and completeness, helping staff focus on high-value cases. Meanwhile, broker insights agents can analyze producer performance and engagement trends, helping insurers guide outreach, improve channel effectiveness, and refine distribution strategy. These examples show how agents can help reduce administrative burden, shorten cycle times, and improve both consistency and responsiveness across the insurance value chain. Shaping the future 38 In particular, underwriting is an exciting near-term area where agentic AI can ease manual workload and improve decision quality. Today, underwriters must gather and assess applicant and asset data from a range of fragmented sources, such as property records, inspection reports, and credit agencies, then apply static rules and checklists to assess risk. When data is missing or inconsistent, applications are escalated for manual review, creating delays and inconsistent evaluations. An underwriting support agent can automate this process end-to-end. It can ingest data from internal and external sources, including satellite imagery or weather databases, apply underwriting logic to generate individualized risk scores, and flag outliers (such as roof damage or unexplained prior claims) for human review. This allows underwriters to focus on the highest-value decisions, significantly accelerating cycle times and enabling faster, more consistent, and data-driven quote generation at scale across property and casualty lines.

Advisor teams can deploy wealth advisor agents to synthesize financial goals, account data, and transaction history to generate tailored investment plans, monitor portfolio drift, and dynamically adjust recommendations over time. Data harmonization agents can align inputs across CRM, policy, and risk systems, ensuring that advisors work from a complete and accurate client view. Meanwhile, high-value client routing agents can detect key service moments, such as large deposits or market events, and proactively reassign high-priority accounts to senior advisors. These examples show how agents can help scale personalization, improve advisor productivity, and drive stronger client retention in an increasingly competitive wealth management landscape. Shaping the future 39 Specifically, personalized financial planning stands out as a high-potential near-term area for agentic transformation in Wealth Management, where the ability to deliver timely, relevant advice remains constrained by legacy practices. Many advisors still operate with static planning templates, infrequent client check-ins, and fragmented data sources, making it difficult to tailor recommendations to evolving client needs. Time is often lost aggregating account data, tracking portfolio drift, and identifying rebalancing triggers, limiting both responsiveness and advisor productivity. A wealth advisor agent can automate this process, aggregating account data, transaction history, and financial goals to generate tailored strategies. It monitors for portfolio drift, flags rebalancing opportunities, and proactively recommends updates. This empowers advisors to deliver precision-tailored guidance that evolves with each client’s goals, enabling more timely decisions, stronger engagement, and higher long-term value. Assess financial profile Generate personalized plan Monitor & optimize portfolio Engage client & execute Advisor collects some data Advisor builds financial plan Advisor periodically reviews Advisor reaches out to client from client (e.g., submitted using in-house tools and portfolio manually, scans and executes trades or financial statements) then static assumptions, with market updates, and adjusts adjustments after review Illustrative inputs into planning software limited personalization plan infrequently current workflow AI agent aggregates all AI agent builds customized AI agent continuously AI agent proactively available customer data (e.g., financial plans (e.g., for analyzes market trends, cash recommends actions, sends Illustrative spending behavior, credit data, retirement) using modeling flow, portfolio drift, spending updates on performance, and agentic AI account balances) & evaluates aligned with client profile, patterns to flag optimization executes approved trades or workflow against financial goals context, and risk or rebalancing opportunities plan adjustments Exhibit 5.10: Agentic AI delivers personalized wealth planning and execution across the full client lifecycle in Wealth Management Financial Services/Insurance: Banking In Banking, agentic AI can improve both customer onboarding and core operational workflows. KYC verification agents help streamline identity checks by gathering documents, screening against watchlists, and completing onboarding steps automatically. Banks can also deploy payments exception agents to quickly resolve failed transactions, model governance agents to monitor and flag compliance risks, and client segmentation agents to tailor engagement strategies based on customer behavior. Together, these use cases show how agents can reduce regulatory friction, enhance service reliability, and improve customer experience. In particular, we have observed that KYC verification is emerging as a high-impact opportunity for agentic transformation in banking, given its regulatory importance and operational complexity. Today, teams must manually collect identity documents, verify Shaping the future 40 them against internal records or registries, and screen applicants against watchlists and sanctions databases. This fragmented process slows down onboarding, increases risk exposure, and often results in rework when data is missing or flagged late. A KYC verification agent can streamline this process while improving both customer experience and compliance rigor. It can ingest identity documents and form data from intake portals, validate them using internal and external sources, and screen applicants in real time against politically exposed persons (PEP), anti-money laundering (AML), and sanctions lists. By auto-completing onboarding for low-risk customers and routing only complex cases to compliance, the agent eliminates a major bottleneck in account activation, accelerating customer access, strengthening regulatory assurance, and freeing operations teams to focus on higher-value oversight.

Securities underwriting agents can aggregate filings, market data, and risk inputs to streamline issuance and reduce manual documentation. Exception pattern analysis agents help identify and resolve issues like trade mismatches or delayed settlements, while security and anomaly detection agents monitor for unusual behavior or access risks. These agents support faster decision-making and help teams navigate complex regulatory requirements. Many of these use cases extend beyond capital markets. Exception pattern analysis agents can be applied in banking, payments, or supply chain workflows to proactively detect and resolve process failures. Security and anomaly detection agents are equally relevant in data-sensitive sectors like healthcare and public sector. For SIs, these cross-industry applications offer a path to deploy proven agentic solutions more broadly, accelerating time-to-value and expanding impact across clients. Shaping the future 41 Taken together, these use cases demonstrate how agentic AI can reshape core operations across the Financial Services and Insurance landscape. By embedding intelligence into critical workflows—underwriting, wealth planning, onboarding, and beyond—agents enable faster execution, improved consistency, and more personalized client engagement. For SIs, this represents a meaningful opportunity to drive measurable impact by helping institutions modernize legacy processes, enhance decision quality, and scale the capabilities needed to compete in a more data-driven, real-time financial environment. Shaping the future 42 Healthcare/Life Sciences Healthcare and Life Sciences organizations face persistent pressures to deliver more with limited resources. Providers are strained by staff shortages and administrative overhead, payers continue to struggle with slow, error-prone claims adjudication processes that increase administrative burden and delay reimbursements, and life sciences firms contend with fragmented trial coordination and long development cycles. These challenges slow down care, increase costs, and make it harder to bring new treatments to market.

Care coordination agents can support full patient journey management, including tracking plans, surfacing follow-ups, and flagging readmission risks to guide proactive engagement. Medical diagnostics agents can assist clinicians by analyzing notes, labs, and imaging to suggest likely diagnoses and highlight risk patterns. At the administrative level, credentialing automation agents can verify licenses, track expirations, and streamline onboarding processes. These use cases help providers deliver more coordinated, timely, and compliant care. Amid the opportunities above, care coordination is drawing the strongest near-term excitement, as providers look to tackle the root causes of care delays and clinician overload. Today, patient intake and care coordination require staff to manually validate eligibility, assess symptoms, schedule follow-ups, and ensure handoffs between providers. These workflows are not only time-consuming but also vulnerable to dropped tasks, contributing to preventable readmissions and poor patient experience. In contrast, a care coordination agent can independently ingest intake forms, verify patient identity and insurance across systems, triage based on urgency and readmission risk, and coordinate appointments or follow-up actions. By continuously monitoring patient status and system availability, the agent ensures timely, well-coordinated care from intake through discharge. This elevates care continuity, reduces the risk of readmission, and allows clinical staff to spend more time where it matters most, delivering high-touch, patient-centered care.

Clinical trial ops agents help research teams manage study trial startup by reviewing site documentation, confirming readiness criteria, and coordinating enrollment workflows, shortening trial timelines. Manufacturing quality agents monitor production data in real time to detect anomalies, flag deviations, and initiate corrective actions, reducing compliance risks and ensuring batch reliability. At the front end of the pipeline, drug discovery agents analyze literature, trial results, and biological datasets to identify promising targets and suggest candidate molecules. These agents support faster, more informed decisions, ultimately helping bring safer therapies to market faster. In particular, clinical trial operations agents offer a substantial opportunity to demonstrate the impact of agentic AI augmentation, where agents can streamline the time-intensive process of getting trials up and running. Today, clinical research associates (CRAs) manually review site readiness documents, coordinate access to trial platforms, and track enrollment status across systems. Much of this effort is spent chasing down information, validating paperwork, and communicating updates to investigators and sponsors. A clinical trial operations agent can take on these tasks: reviewing qualification documents, verifying readiness criteria, assigning study system access, and monitoring trial milestones. It can also scan Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and registries to identify eligible patients for recruitment and sync Clinical Trial Management Systems (CTMS), freeing up CRAs to focus on trial design and relationship management. By eliminating administrative bottlenecks and streamlining enrollment workflows, agentic trial operations agents accelerate trial startup, reduce delays in patient recruitment, and help sponsors bring therapies to market with greater speed, precision, and confidence.

In provider environments, agents can help unlock clinical capacity and improve care continuity by taking on coordination and administrative load. For payers, agents can bring new levels of precision, consistency, and speed to claims adjudication and risk assessment. And in life sciences, they can accelerate time-to-market by streamlining R&D and trial operations. As demands rise and systems grow more complex, agentic AI offers the potential to fundamentally rewire how healthcare and life sciences organizations operate, advancing speed, quality, and impact across the value chain. Shaping the future 47 Automotive/Industrial In Auto and Industrial settings, coordination isn’t just a challenge; it’s also a competitive constraint. Supplier networks are complex, customer expectations are rising, and lean inventory strategies leave little margin for error. Despite digital tools, many critical workflows, like maintenance and B2B sales, still rely on reactive decisions and disconnected systems.

Some of these examples, such as inventory and logistics optimization, have broad applicability to other sectors, such as Healthcare, highlighted here to show the ‘art of the possible’ when applied with an industry-specific lens. Automotive/Industrial: Automotive In Automotive, agentic AI can drive impact across engineering, operations, and sales by enhancing reliability, efficiency, and decision-making. Engineering teams can deploy predictive maintenance agents to analyze machine or vehicle telemetry, identify early signs of equipment failure, and trigger proactive service interventions, reducing costly downtime. Logistics optimization agents can support operations by dynamically adjusting load plans based on capacity constraints and real-time delivery schedules. On the commercial side, intelligent sales enablement agents can pinpoint at-risk regions, monitor real-time performance data, and recommend targeted interventions to improve conversion and customer retention. These agentic AI solutions tackle longstanding challenges across the automotive value chain, from production floors to dealership networks. Among the opportunities outlined above, predictive maintenance is surfacing as a leading use case, as even short periods of unplanned downtime can derail production schedules or delay order fulfillment. Today, technicians must review dashboards, logs, and sensor data manually to identify anomalies and decide whether intervention is needed, often after a breakdown has already occurred. An agentic AI system can continuously monitor equipment telemetry, detect early signs of failure, determine likely root causes based on historical data, and initiate service requests or adjust production schedules accordingly. The agent can also learn from past events to improve its predictive accuracy over time. This proactive, closed-loop approach not only minimizes downtime and improves asset utilization but also unlocks capacity for engineering teams to focus on high-leverage innovation, turning maintenance from a cost center into a competitive advantage. This productivity unlock for engineers can also translate to significant value for SIs. Roughly ~39% of the total U.S. SI services value pool in Auto/Industrials is linked to ‘Engineer’ tasks (Exhibit 5.16), indicating the directional opportunity this agent can offer. Shaping the future 49 Monitor machine Detect failure Diagnose Initiate resolution Close loop and learn condition or issue root cause Technicians review Issues are usually Field engineers / Maintenance teams Teams update logs or dashboards and flagged after a maintenance teams raise work orders, issue reports; insights machine status reports breakdown or when inspect equipment and schedule downtime, are rarely fed back Illustrative periodically to identify performance degrades review logs to identify and dispatch systematically current anomalies root cause technicians workflow AI agent continuously AI agent predicts AI agent correlates AI agent generates AI agent logs incident, monitors telemetry, potential failure modes anomalies across maintenance requests captures resolution Illustrative sensor data, and usage using ML models and systems, references and coordinates repair details, updates agentic AI logs to detect early flags high-risk historical incidents, scheduling with predictive models to workflow signs of failure equipment in advance determines root causes technicians, etc. improve accuracy Exhibit 5.17: Agentic AI shifts equipment maintenance in Automotive from reactive troubleshooting to proactive failure prevention Automotive/Industrial: Industrial In Industrial sectors, agentic AI is poised to enhance productivity, compliance, and resilience across engineering, operations, and finance functions. Engineering teams can leverage safety compliance agents to monitor worksite telemetry, detect hazardous conditions, and trigger risk mitigation workflows, helping reduce incidents and improve regulatory adherence. Operations leaders can benefit from logistics and inventory agents that optimize route planning, balance material flows, and minimize costly surplus or shortages across distributed sites. Finance teams can deploy supplier risk mitigation agents to proactively flag performance issues, reroute orders, and maintain supply chain continuity during disruptions. These AI-driven solutions help industrial players overcome persistent inefficiencies while building smarter, safer, and more agile operations. Within this broad landscape, momentum is building around B2B sales, the revenue engine for most industrial firms. Agentic solutions for sales tasks alone roughly drive ~23% of the total U.S. SI services value pool in Auto/Industrials (Exhibit 5.16). Many teams today continue to face challenges identifying and converting high-quality leads with speed and precision. Sales representatives often rely on static lists, basic firmographics, and manual follow-up processes that are slow to scale and difficult to personalize. A B2B sales agent can monitor inbound inquiries, analyze firm-level data, qualify high- potential opportunities, generate tailored proposals, and coordinate order placement through connected systems. It can also track engagement and adapt messaging based on buyer behavior. By automating routine tasks, sales teams can concentrate on strategic engagement and closing complex deals, unlocking new levels of speed, precision, and scale that traditional sales workflows struggle to achieve.

By turning fragmented data into real-time, cross-system action, agents help organizations move from reactive problem-solving to proactive, resilient operations. The result: faster decisions, smarter workflows, and value creation beyond the reach of traditional automation. Shaping the future 51 Public Sector Public institutions are expected to deliver services with speed, consistency, and transparency, often while operating on legacy infrastructure and limited capacity. From benefits processing to public communications, many agencies still depend on manual workflows and fragmented platforms that delay responses and strain overstretched teams.

Agents can automate system monitoring, flag anomalies, and route issues for resolution, enhancing uptime and accelerating issue triage in overstretched IT environments. Data analyst agents can synthesize inputs across legacy systems, generate reports, and surface insights for program evaluation or policy planning. These use cases not only strengthen digital resilience in government but also carry relevance across other sectors with large-scale, distributed systems, such as Healthcare/Life Sciences, Auto/Industrial, and beyond. A wide range of agentic AI use cases is emerging: benefits processing agents can help reduce delays by verifying eligibility, approving claims, and routing exceptions across fragmented systems. Fraud detection agents offer a more scalable approach to oversight by analyzing behavioral data and surfacing anomalies for review. Communications agents can accelerate how agencies craft and distribute time-sensitive public messages, routing content for approval and adapting it by channel. Among these opportunities, fraud detection is likely to be broadly applicable across agencies, where today’s processes are often reactive and resource-intensive. Analysts must manually monitor transaction logs, flag anomalies based on static rules, and initiate investigations across siloed systems. The result is delayed detection, at times inconsistent risk scoring, and significant effort spent on false positives. By addressing these pain points, SIs can unlock productivity for Public Sector finance departments; we estimate tasks in the total ‘Finance’ segment account for roughly ~18% of the total U.S. SI services Public Sector value pool (Exhibit 5.19). A fraud detection agent can continuously ingest data across systems, surface anomalous behaviors in real time, and trigger case workflows with supporting evidence already attached. It can escalate high-risk issues with evidence already attached, generate audit trails automatically, and continuously improve detection logic, enabling faster investigations, stronger oversight, and a more scalable model for enforcing accountability.

Today, drafting public updates, coordinating reviews across departments, and publishing to multiple channels is slow and error-prone. A communications agent can monitor for relevant events or triggers, draft initial message variants tailored to the audience and channel, and route them through legal, policy, and leadership approval flows. Once approved, it can be published across platforms (e.g., web, SMS, email, social) and track engagement or sentiment in real time. For agencies managing emergencies or policy changes, this enables faster, clearer outreach at scale, reducing delays, minimizing confusion, and helping overextended teams maintain trust and transparency with the public. From an SI perspective, this solution offers significant value to tap into. This agent could become a staple tool for Public Sector marketing departments, which is a segment that is in total driving approximately ~15% of the total U.S. SI services Public Sector value pool (Exhibit 5.19).

By automating high-volume, coordination-heavy workflows and embedding intelligence into decision processes, agents can help agencies deliver faster, more consistent services, communicate with clarity at scale, and uphold institutional transparency. This unlocks a new standard of responsiveness and accountability, empowering governments to meet rising public expectations while doing more with less. Shaping the future 54 Taken together, the use cases across these six industries reflect a growing shift in what enterprise customers expect: not just tools or platforms, but solutions that directly address their most pressing pain points, such as claims delays, inventory mismatches, fragmented service delivery, and more. Agentic AI presents a way to meet those expectations, but it won’t implement itself. SIs are uniquely positioned to close the gap between ambition and execution by helping clients identify the right entry points, design agentic workflows that map to real business processes, and scale those solutions across organizations.

We acknowledge the various public and proprietary data sources, including market research firms, governmental labor statistics organizations, and specialized data providers, whose information was essential for our market sizing analysis. Specific sources are cited where appropriate. Shaping the future 61 Detailed methodology for sizing agentic AI value pools U.S. value pools Our buildup of the addressable market size was calculated as follows: Estimate the total economic value of work activities We started by mapping the U.S. workforce across 150 job titles and 7 job families (admin, engineer, finance, marketing, operations, sales, and scientist) using data from Revelio. Revelio aggregates public employee and compensation information (e.g., LinkedIn), triangulated with U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. For each role, we multiplied the total FTE counts with the average compensation (salary and benefits) to estimate the total economic value of work activities. This economic value was broken down into six industry categories and an ‘other’ bucket: Technology/Telecommunications, Media, Entertainment, Gaming (Tech/TMEG); Financial Services/Insurance; Auto/Industrial; Healthcare/Life Sciences; Public Sector; Retail/Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG); and Other (e.g., business consulting, advertising, hospitality). Estimate the potential value of augmentation with agentic AI To estimate the potential for agentic AI augmentation, we estimated the distribution of time spent, for each job title, on a variety of task groups (~330 in total), and subsequently assessed the potential for augmentation with agentic AI for these tasks. Role Task Task frequency Task frequency total % of time allocation (Surveyed frequency (Sum of total hours) (Task hours / total hours) converted to hours) Role 1 Task 1 Hourly (~4 hours/day) 5.25 hours 76% Task 2 2x daily (~1 hour per day) 5.25 hours 19% Task 3 Weekly (~.25 hours per 5.25 hours 5% day) For time distribution estimation, we utilized O*NET, a U.S. Department of Labor-funded database, which provides task-level frequency data for ~800 job titles. This provided us with an analytical pathway to estimate a unique distribution of time spent on various tasks for each job category. For presentation purposes, we grouped these underlying tasks into eight categories, shown in Exhibit B.1 below Shaping the future 62 Task group Description Illustrative tasks Data collection, Gathering, recording, • Maintain operational records synthesis & processing, and updating • Maintain current knowledge or expertise documentation data to understand events, • Evaluate quality/accuracy of data actions, and information • Collect consumer needs/opinions • Prepare documentation • Gather operational/development data • Read documents/materials Analytics & Examining data, processes, • Analyze business/financial data performance and quality standards to • Analyze data to improve operations evaluation make informed assessments, • Analyze market/industry conditions ensure compliance, and • Monitor financial/health data quantify outcomes • Evaluate product/technology performance • Monitor regulatory compliance Creative Interpreting information • Create visual displays thinking and thinking creatively to • Design IT systems/applications & problem resolve problems and make • Implement procedures/processes solving decisions • Develop business/marketing/education plans • Authorize transactions • Explain technical details Resource & Monitoring, controlling, and • Recruit/hire operations managing people, systems, • Execute financial transactions management tools, and processes to • Process data coordinate resources • Purchase goods/services effectively • Perform administrative/clerical tasks • Replenish inventory • Operate office equipment Work Developing objectives • Develop policies/procedures preparation by organizing, planning, • Schedule appointments/activities & planning prioritizing, and scheduling • Plan work/events/programs work • Draft legislation/regulations Supervision, Supervising, training, and • Direct operations training & coaching others to guide • Supervise personnel development and improve skillset and • Train on procedures performance • Provide support/encouragement • Teach academic/vocational subjects • Assign/coordinate tasks Shaping the future 63 Task group Description Illustrative tasks Communication Communicating with • Inform guests/clients & relationships people inside and outside • Communicate on operations/specifications the organization to consult, • Advise on business/products sell, maintain interpersonal • Respond to customer inquiries relationships, and provide care • Develop professional networks Physical/ Performing physical activities • Clean/inspect tools/facilities manual tasks via operating vehicles/ • Dispose of waste equipment, handing objects, • Prepare mixtures/food/beverages inspecting resources, and • Operate vehicles/equipment maintaining equipment • Move/package objects • Arrange displays After we determined this distribution of task time, we conducted a bottom- up assessment to understand which tasks are likely augmentable by agentic AI, applying a framework based on gating criteria and technical fit factors. For each filter, a task could be rated “Yes,” “No,” or “Partial.” Gating criteria: 1. Is the task carried out primarily through digital interactions rather than physical or manual actions? 2. Does the task largely rely on objective, transactional exchanges rather than nuanced emotional interpersonal judgement? Technical fit factors: 1. Does the task follow a structured workflow without excessive ambiguity or open-ended reasoning? 2. Are the data inputs available and observable by a potential agentic AI system? 3. Is the task’s outcome covered by rule-based logic rooted in existing documentation or precedents? Shaping the future 64 Assessement of agentic AI task addressability Questionnaire applied to each of ~330 underlying tasks Steps Questions Task marked ‘yes’ when: Task marked ‘partial’ when: Task marked ‘no’ when: 01 Is the task carried out primarily Is completed largely digitally Task required in-person, manual Gating through digital interactions rather e.g., gather info from electronic dexterity e.g., prepare food factors than physical or manual actions? sources and beverage preventing Does the task largely rely on Is largely transactional, objective Addressability may vary by how a Task depends on agentic AI objective, transactional exchanges e.g., read documents or materials task is structured or the specific emotional/social cues e.g., use rather than nuanced emotional context it is performed in investigate criminal/legal interpersonal judgement? matters This variability occurs across different instances in the same job role 02 Does the task follow a structured Clear, repeatable steps/logic Task has number of undefined Task is a workflow without excessive ambiguity e.g., gather infor from e.g., doctors “providing health processes e.g., develop technical or open-ended reasoning? electronic sources advice” may range from a routine organizational goals or objectives fit for phone check-in to a complex agentic AI Are the data inputs available and Uses structured data that AI diagnosis requiring emotional Task uses unstructured/ observable by a potential agentic retrieves reliably e.g., estimate intelligence and nuanced human inaccessible data e.g., monitor AI system? project development costs communication individual behavior Is the task’s outcome covered by Has logic/decision trees that can Task requires expert intuition rule-based logic rooted in existing be derived using existing datasets or judgement e.g., maintain documentation or precedents? e.g., test performance of safety/security computers Included in value pool sizing? All ‘yes’ answers indicate high All ‘yes’ and some ‘partial’ ‘No’ on any question indicates agentic AI applicability indicates mod. applicability low agentic AI applicability (85-90% of task time) (40-50% of task time) Exhibit B.2: Task agentic AI addressability assessment criteria We assigned tasks to different AI augmentation levels, and to embed conservatism, account for some time being retained by humans for higher- level tasks, and/or exception handling: • Fully augmentable (85-90% of task time) if the task passes all five criteria with “Yes”. • Partially augmentable (40-50% of task time) if the task passes all five criteria with “Yes” or “Partial”. • Not augmentable (0% of task time) if the task fails any one factor (“No”). This structure allowed us to compute the percentage of each job’s time for which agentic AI is applicable for each of the 150 job roles, and the related portion of labor value. An illustrative sample of these roles is shown in Exhibit B.3.

Based on partner interviews and secondary research, we estimate that the application layer could capture approximately 10-30% of the total compensation dollars that could be augmented by agentic AI. Job categories with high agentic addressability (greater than 50% of total job time) bias toward the upper end of this range. For other roles, we assumed the lower end of this range, based on benchmarks from BCG and Salesforce case studies, as well as market participant insights on past software and gen AI deployments, which suggest application layer capture in the 10–15% range. This resulted in a total U.S. application layer value pool of approximately ~$1T.

Healthcare Public Retail/ Other Sector CPG Share of total value 19% 16% 15% 9% 8% 6% 26% Exhibit B.4: Estimated U.S. application value pool for agentic AI Estimating the SI services value pool Finally, we estimated the amount of value that can be translated from the application layer specifically to SI services, assuming a ‘full potential’ steady state scenario. As a starting point, we exclude Small and Medium-Sized Businesses (SMBs) and lower middle-market firms (<500 FTEs). From what remains, we translate the spend on agentic applications to spend on SI services to advise on, implement, and maintain those applications. At the project level, the ratio of SI services to application spend can vary widely depending on the complexity, customization, and scope of the deployment, whether agentic or otherwise. Case studies based on information from BCG and Forrester show that SI services spend can be as low as 0.2x the application spend for relatively simple, off-the- shelf customer service agents. In contrast, highly tailored implementations that involve full-stack modernization or deep workflow integration, such as traditional CRM/ERP deployments and bespoke agents built from the ground up, can drive SI spend up to 4x+ the application layer. This variance reflects how different each technology deployment can be, depending on use case, industry, and enterprise readiness. However, when we zoom out to the market level, this variance will be averaged away. Market estimates from sources such as Gartner and IDC suggest that SI services spend typically lands in the range of $0.70-$0.90 per $1 of application software spend, tending towards the higher end of this range when isolating for larger companies.3 This reflects the Shaping the future 67 average mix of advisory, implementation, and ongoing support work that accompanies enterprise-grade software adoption. With these data points in mind, we use a midpoint assumption that $0.70-$0.80 will be spent on SI services per $1 of agentic AI application spend. This range reflects a market- level steady state, balancing high- and low-intensity deployments, while assuming a mix of recurring and non-recurring services. In practice, this means that some share of advisory and implementation work will ‘recycle’ across customers and projects over time, much like in the broader enterprise SaaS market today. Importantly, we also exclude spend associated with job roles that have low agentification potential (<20%), as these roles are less likely to require material SI involvement. Together, these assumptions yield an estimated total SI services value pool of ~$350B to $450B in the U.S., based on an application layer value pool of ~$1T.

This scale-up methodology involved a series of steps to estimate the labor value addressable by agentic AI, the application layer value pool, and ultimately the SI services value pool across different regions. Calculating the global economic value of work activities We determined each country’s total labor value using ILO data, starting with the number of employees in each International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) job role and industry. This covered approximately 3 billion employees, or 95% of global wage workers. We then multiplied the number of employees by the average salary. Salary figures were grossed up using US-calculated salary-to-compensation ratios to arrive at total compensation value. Determining the potential global value of augmentation with agentic AI We calculated the percentage of time augmentable by agentic AI for each global job role. This involved converting our U.S. 150-role taxonomy to nine ISCO roles. We then applied the U.S.-derived ISCO role agentification rates to the global dataset. Shaping the future 69 Estimating the global application layer and SI services value pool We applied the same assumptions for application layer value capture and translation into SI services as in our detailed U.S. sizing methodology. Through these steps, we calculated a global $0.9-1.1 trillion SI services value pool. North America and EMEA represent the largest opportunities, driven by their significant application layer value pools and knowledge worker-oriented economies.
