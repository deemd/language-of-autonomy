Digital for SMEs (D4SME) Knowledge event 16 September 2025 | Virtual Webinar From prediction to autonomy: What agentic AI means for SMEs What’s the issue? AI is ushering in a new era of autonomy and decision-making in digital systems and the implications for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) could be profound. AI adoption among SMEs is growing rapidly since the release of Generative AI services to the public in 2022: from 6.6% to 11.9% for small businesses and from 12.2% to 20.4% for medium-sized businesses between 2022 and 2024.The overall share still lags significantly behind large firms, 40% of which now report using AI (up from 27.3% in 2022). As the pace of innovation accelerates, ensuring that SMEs are not left behind is more urgent than ever. “AI Agents” are autonomous systems capable of setting goals, making decisions, and executing tasks with a high degree of autonomy from humans. Applications range from software development and customer support to cybersecurity and business intelligence. For SMEs still gaining ground with AI tools, the emergence of agentic AI marks an evolution that brings fresh opportunities and challenges. From AI-driven customer service agents to autonomous supply chain managers, these systems promise to unlock productivity gains previously out of reach for resource-constrained firms. But they also raise new questions about accountability, risk, data governance, and the readiness of firms and markets to adopt them responsibly. Key Highlights • SME adoption of AI is accelerating the “democratisation” the technology, but gaps with large firms persist. By lowering requirements for capital and technical expertise, generative AI can provide SMEs with access to tools once reserved for large corporations. This could level the playing field by reducing administrative burdens, opening access to inclusive financial services, and supporting competitiveness in global markets. • Agentic AI - systems with autonomy, memory and adaptability - is a paradigm shift. This evolution of AI technology is moving beyond reactive tools to proactive collaborators. It could help SMEs automate tasks, personalise services and expand innovation, while raising new challenges of governance, accountability and readiness. • Barriers to adoption remain significant. SMEs face resource constraints, integration challenges, fast-changing technology cycles, and difficulties in building internal and external trust. Concerns around bias, liability, data security and workforce preparedness were raised as critical obstacles that need to be addressed. • Policy and governance priorities should centre on enabling responsible adoption. Speakers called for investment in digital and financial literacy, TRISM frameworks (trust, risk and security management), and interoperability standards to avoid vendor lock-in. Proportionate regulation and regulatory sandboxes were highlighted as essential to balance innovation with oversight, making compliance the “easy choice” for SMEs. • SME ecosystem collaboration is critical. Associations, hubs and partnerships can act as multipliers, helping SMEs test solutions, share use cases and build confidence. Peer learning and cooperation with larger firms, academia and civil society can provide SMEs with adoption pathways. • International alignment is crucial. Initiatives at the OECD, UN and industry fora were seen as vital to develop common standards, foster trust, and enable SMEs to adopt agentic AI securely, responsibly and inclusively. 2 AGENDA 16:00-16:30 Introduction Moderated by Mr Nadim Ahmad, Deputy Director, OECD Centre for Entrepreneurship, SMEs, Regions and Cities (CFE) 16:05-16:15 Welcome remarks Deputy Minister Valentino Valentini, Ministry of Enterprises and Made in Italy, D4SME Chair 16:15 – 16:30 Keynote Professor Angela Aristidou, Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship, University College London School of Management 16:30 – 17:00 Panel 1.

He highlighted recent achievements of the Initiative: the D4SME Survey on SME digitalisation for competitiveness; the 6th Digital for SME (D4SME) Roundtable, which gathered in Paris 150 participants from 52 countries; and the launch of the SMEs in the Digital Economy Stakeholder Pledge, on the impulse of Deputy Minister Valentini. He noted that AI adoption among SMEs is accelerating across the OECD, with adoption by small businesses almost doubling between 2022 and 2024 from 6.6% to 11.9% and from 12.2% to 20.4% in medium sized businesses, though a gap with large firms remains (40%). At the frontier, agentic AI could help SMEs automate processes, personalise services and scale innovation, but it also raises questions of accountability, governance and readiness. • Deputy Minister Valentino Valentini, Ministry of Enterprises and Made in Italy, D4SME Chair Deputy Minister Valentino Valentini framed agentic AI as the most transformative shift since the internet revolution, stressing that SMEs face a choice between fear and opportunity. He recalled the SMEs in the Digital Economy Stakeholder Pledge to leave no SME behind in the digital transition and underlined that agentic AI is not just another tool, but a paradigm shift, from reactive systems to proactive collaborators. SME uptake of AI continues to trail that of larger enterprises, and the Deputy Minister noted that without targeted support this gap may persist. At the same time, he underlined AI’s potential to broaden access to advanced technologies, enabling smaller firms to benefit from tools that were once available only to large corporations and thereby contributing to a more level playing field. To seize these opportunities, he called for investment in digital literacy, the establishment of TRISM frameworks (trust, risk and security management), interoperability standards to avoid vendor lock-in, and balanced regulation, citing the EU AI Act as both necessary and enabling. He concluded by urging SMEs to act as “architects of the future” rather than passive observers, stressing that the choice is to embrace transformation with courage and collaboration, or risk being left behind. • Professor Angela Aristidou, Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship, University College London School of Management Professor Angela Aristidou provided a keynote address setting the scene for the panel discussions. She explained the evolution from traditional AI to generative AI and now to agentic AI, which she described as systems with autonomy, memory, adaptability and integration capabilities. Unlike static tools, agentic AI can take initiative, learn from experience, and connect with external data and applications to complete tasks. 4 She underlined that the main challenge is not technological progress but imagination and trust. Drawing parallels with the slow diffusion of electricity, she noted that SMEs will need time to reconfigure processes and business models to capture the benefits of agentic AI. For smaller firms, the technology may reduce barriers by lowering requirements for capital, compute and technical expertise, potentially allowing them to leapfrog directly to agentic AI solutions. Yet issues of integration, workforce skills, and trust in autonomous decision-making remain central. Aristidou concluded that agentic AI holds great promise to expand SME capabilities: from rapid experimentation to new forms of business intelligence, but that success will depend on building SME-friendly tools, interoperability, and collaborative ecosystems that support responsible adoption. Panel 1: Reinventing SMEs with Agentic AI? Panel 1 examined how agentic AI systems - tools capable of autonomous goal setting, decision-making, and task execution - could reshape the operational and financial models of SMEs. Panellists explored how agentic AI can help SMEs overcome resource constraints, while also highlighting risks of dependency, governance gaps, and uneven adoption. • Levelling the playing field Panellists stressed that agentic AI has the potential to “democratise” advanced technologies. By automating complex processes such as supply-chain management, pricing and customer discovery, AI agents could offer SMEs capabilities once reserved for large corporations. This, as Michelle Gill noted, would free small business owners from administrative burdens and allow them to focus on growth, while also opening opportunities to reach global markets. She warned, however, that SMEs must not be “disintermediated” in AI-mediated marketplaces, where discoverability depends on clear product and service descriptions rather than search rankings. Josefina Movillo Matta stressed that in Chile, where SMEs represent 98% of firms and 65% of jobs, agentic AI could be a tool to make financial services more inclusive and expand innovation beyond early adopters. She also pointed to emerging pilots where SMEs use AI as virtual CFOs to monitor cash flow, negotiate with suppliers, and access credit. • Lowering barriers to adoption A recurring theme was that agentic AI may lower some of the traditional barriers SMEs face in digital transformation. Benjamin Chino highlighted that unlike earlier forms of AI, agentic AI can be accessible even to firms without large budgets or technical teams. At Maki People, recruitment agents can be deployed in days without specialist expertise, allowing SMEs to experiment quickly and scale solutions once value is demonstrated. He argued that SMEs’ flexibility may allow them to adopt and scale AI faster than larger firms. Josefina Movillo Matta added that peer-to-peer learning, networking and collaboration are particularly powerful in lowering entry barriers, helping firms learn from practical examples rather than navigating adoption alone. 5 • Challenges and risks Despite this promise, several challenges were identified. All speakers emphasised that SMEs face a multi- layered trust challenge, first building confidence within their own teams, then earning the trust of customers, and finally demonstrating compliance to regulators. This challenge is particularly acute in sensitive areas such as hiring and financial services, where concerns over bias, transparency, and liability are especially high. As Benjamin Chino highlighted, these pressures are compounded by limited resources and the rapid pace of technological change, which make it difficult for SMEs to keep up. Michelle Gill further added that fast- changing compliance requirements impose heavy burdens on SMEs, citing OECD D4SME survey evidence showing that many SMEs remain uncertain about how to use AI and are concerned about privacy and liability. Josefina Movillo Matta finally emphasised that, for many firms, the challenge is less technological than human: developing the talent, digital capabilities and the data infrastructure to use new tools effectively. • Policy and governance priorities Panellists converged on key priorities for enabling responsible adoption: Regulatory simplicity and proportionality: Michelle Gill urged governments to clarify that existing o consumer protection laws apply to AI-enabled commerce, rather than layering new complexity. Josefina Movillo Matta called for proportionate regulation that balances innovation with safeguards. Capacity building: Josefina Movillo Matta emphasised investment in digital and financial literacy, o talent development, and cybersecurity, supported through public-private collaboration, to appropriately identify needs and combine resources. Evaluation and standards: Benjamin Chino stressed the importance of evaluation frameworks and o trusted partners in sensitive domains such as recruitment, and Josefina Movillo Matta added that interoperability standards are essential to avoid vendor lock-in. Ecosystem support and adoption pathways: Michelle Gill called for governments to establish o innovation hubs and economic incentives that combine public and private resources, ensuring SMEs can access AI-powered discovery and commerce. Benjamin Chino added that SMEs themselves should adopt agentic AI step by step: starting small, proving value, and then scaling, supported by policies that make experimentation possible. Conclusion: Taken together, the panel underscored that agentic AI could be a powerful enabler for SMEs - but only if adoption is accompanied by the right mix of skills, standards, and collaborative frameworks to ensure trust, fairness and inclusion. Panel 2. Shaping Agentic AI Adoption by SMEs Panel 2 examined how stakeholders including governments, technology providers, and industry associations can cooperate to support SMEs in adopting agentic AI, and how to balance innovation with responsible regulation. The discussion highlighted the need for cross-sector collaboration, adaptive governance, and clear safeguards to ensure that SMEs can benefit from AI without being overwhelmed by risks or compliance burdens. 6 • Building the conditions for adoption Panellists agreed that creating the right conditions for adoption requires both public investment and private- sector leadership. Almudena Martín Castro explained that Spain’s Strategic Projects Unit acts as a connector across ministries, industries, and associations to identify where AI adoption could generate the greatest societal and economic impact, while also considering trade-offs such as labour market disruption, environmental costs, and Europe’s technological sovereignty. Spain’s Kit Digital and Red.es programmes were highlighted as examples of financial support that lower upfront costs and provide advisory services, enabling SMEs to experiment with digital tools. Panellists also highlighted the crucial role of industry associations in supporting AI adoption and diffusion among SMEs. Usman Ikhlaq, added that industry associations and hubs act as critical enablers, creating shared spaces for SMEs to exchange knowledge, overcome legacy barriers, and build the confidence needed to experiment with new AI tools. • Responsible innovation and safeguards Speakers emphasised that adoption must be accompanied by safeguards. Hector de Rivoire argued that the true test of AI’s value lies not in frontier models but in their integration into everyday business, particularly for SMEs. Advances in reasoning and multimodal training have enabled more agentic behaviours, such as sequencing tasks and calling external tools, but these dual-use features carry risks: the same system that patches vulnerabilities could also generate malware. To mitigate such risks, Microsoft has embedded governance into product development, including a Sensitive Use Case team, systematic red-teaming, and post-deployment monitoring. Almudena Martín Castro added that large technology providers have a key role in scaling safe, shared solutions, while Usman Ikhlaq underlined that SMEs need trusted frameworks to assess and mitigate risk without excessive compliance costs. • Ecosystem cooperation and SME readiness Panellists stressed that effective adoption depends on cooperation across the wider ecosystem and on strengthening SME capabilities. Usman Ikhlaq noted that techUK’s SME membership illustrates both the opportunities and barriers in practice, emphasising the need to build AI literacy (basic understanding of what AI is) and AI fluency (the skills to apply and supervise it responsibly). He further stressed the importance of developing soft skills such oversight, explainability, and knowing when to intervene. For SMEs, he concurred Benjamin Chino that the most effective approach is to “think big but start small,” testing use cases aligned with business goals and scaling gradually. Almudena Martín Castro highlighted the role of INDESIA, an industrial data and AI association where large firms co-develop use cases that are then shared with SMEs, as an example of how associations can diffuse innovation and foster cultural change. Finally, Hector de Rivoire added that collaboration across industry, academia, policymakers, and civil society is essential to building a credible “science of AI safety and evaluation” through shared methodologies and evaluation practices. • Policy and governance priorities All panellists agreed that adaptive governance frameworks are needed to balance innovation with oversight. Almudena Martín Castro identified adaptive instruments such as regulatory sandboxes as vital for balancing 7 innovation and oversight, allowing regulators to learn alongside firms. She also called for simpler, more streamlined regulation that makes compliance the “easy choice” for SMEs. Hector de Rivoire highlighted transparency as the backbone of governance, citing the G7 Hiroshima AI Process Reporting Framework, supported by the OECD, as a strong foundation for structured disclosure across the ecosystem. He also called for regulation to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each actor across the AI ecosystem, ensuring shared accountability. Usman Ikhlaq added that legal certainty, proportionate liability, and clarity on penalties are prerequisites for SME confidence, particularly in regulated sectors such as finance or health. Conclusion: In closing, the panellists converged on the importance of international alignment. Initiatives at the UN, OECD and through industry-led frameworks were seen as essential to ensure that agentic AI diffuses across borders in a way that fosters trust, protects rights, and enables SMEs to compete on a more level playing field. Concluding remarks Marco Bianchini, Coordinator of the D4SME Global Initiative, thanked speakers and participants for their contribution to the discussion. He highlighted the broad consensus among experts from government, academia, and both small and large businesses that generative AI, and in particular Agentic AI, could represent a profound shift in how SMEs operate and collaborate. He emphasised the need for governments across the OECD and beyond to closely monitor the evolution in the diffusion of the technology and be prepared to design and implement policies aimed at ensuring its safe and responsible adoption. He concluded the webinar by inviting all participants to the next D4SME knowledge event, scheduled for December 2025.

The D4SME Initiative The “Digital for SMEs” Global Initiative (D4SME) is a multi-stakeholder dialogue engaging governments, large and small businesses, industry experts and associations on how to enable all SMEs to seize the benefits of digitalisation. This initiative is coordinated by the OECD Centre for Entrepreneurship, SMEs, Regions and Cities (CFE) in cooperation with Business at OECD. For more information on the D4SME initiative, please visit: https://www.oecd.org/digital/sme/ 11 For further reading SME Digitalisation for competitiveness: The 2025 OECD D4SME Survey https://doi.org/10.1787/197e3077-en Digitalisation can unlock SME competitiveness, by helping SMEs access new markets and improve the efficiency of their operations. Understanding how SMEs derive value from digitalisation, as well as the barriers they face – whether in adopting new technologies or in adapting their business processes – is key to informing effective policymaking. This 2025 OECD D4SME Survey sheds light on both across ten OECD countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States) in collaboration with digital platform partners of the OECD D4SME Global Initiative. Building on insights from its 2024 edition, the 2025 OECD D4SME Survey provides an updated perspective on SMEs’ digital maturity and practices. It offers a focus on four of our key areas to enhance SME competitiveness through digitalisation: adoption of AI technologies (including generative AI), use of digital tools for sustainability, uptake of fintech solutions, and digital security practices to enhance resilience against cyber threats. SME Digitalisation to manage shocks and transitions: 2024 OECD D4SME Survey https://doi.org/10.1787/eb4ec9ac-en Although uptake of digital practices by SMEs continues to increase, so too has the “digital gap” with larger firms. Understanding the drivers and persisting bottlenecks of SME digitalisation as well as gaining a deeper understanding of their practices and digitalisation processes is key to inform policy decisions to help bridge this gap. This is the primary purpose of the survey this paper draws its findings from, conducted in seven OECD countries (France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Spain and the United States), in co-operation with digital platforms partners of the OECD D4SME Global Initiative. Survey findings provide new insights on SMEs’ digital journeys and how digital tools can support them in navigating short-term challenges and enhancing long-term resilience. The survey also provides evidence about SMEs' use and perception of AI technologies (with a focus on “generative AI”), their application of data analytics for tracking environmental performance, and the impact on mental wellbeing of digital practices in the workplace The Digital Transformation of SMEs https://doi.org/10.1787/20780990 Despite potentially tremendous benefits, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lag in the digital transformation. This report looks at recent trends in SME digital uptake, including in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. It focuses on issues related to digital security, online platforms, block chain ecosystems, and artificial intelligence. It identifies opportunities, risks of not going digital; barriers to adoption and policy actions to speed up SME transformation. 12 Contact OECD Centre for Entrepreneurship, SMEs, Regions and Cities Lucia CUSMANO, Head of SMEs and Entrepreneurship (SMEE) Division Lucia.CUSMANO@oecd.org Marco BIANCHINI, Economist and Co-ordinator of the D4SME Initiative, SMEs and Entrepreneurship (SMEE) Division Marco.BIANCHINI@oecd.org Marta LASHERAS SANCHO, Economist / Policy Analyst, SMEs and Entrepreneurship (SMEE) Division Marta.LASHERASSANCHO@oecd.org About the OECD Centre for Entrepreneurship, SMEs, Regions and Cities The OECD Centre for Entrepreneurship, SMEs, Regions and Cities provides comparative statistics, analysis and capacity building for local and national actors to work together to unleash the potential of entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises, promote inclusive and sustainable regions and cities, boost local job creation, and support sound tourism policies.
