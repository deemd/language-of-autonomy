### Mini-Taxonomy of Definitions of "Agentic AI"

A hybrid qualitative-quantitative analysis was conducted to extract and 
categorize explicit definitions of "agentic AI" across the corpus. The 
methodology combined:

1. **Semi-automatic extraction**: Pattern matching identified 750 
   candidate definitions containing key terms ("agentic AI", "AI agents", 
   "autonomous agents") and definitional markers ("is defined as", "refers to").

2. **Manual validation**: Each candidate was manually reviewed, resulting in 
   750 validated definitions spanning 19 
   reports.

3. **Conceptual categorization**: Definitions were grouped into four primary 
   conceptual frames:


**AI as Copilots/Assistants** (10.5%)
AI agents that augment human work, provide suggestions, collaborate with users

**AI as Autonomous Workers** (12.3%)
AI agents that independently execute tasks with minimal human intervention

**AI as Multi-Agent Ecosystems/Orchestrators** (8.7%)
AI systems coordinating multiple agents, workflows, or complex processes

**AI as Governance/Risk Challenges** (12.9%)
AI agents framed through ethical, regulatory, or risk management lens

#### Results and Interpretation

Figure X presents the distribution of definitions across conceptual categories. 
The dominant frame is **Other/Uncategorized** (55.6%), 
suggesting that the prevailing discourse conceptualizes agentic AI as 
definitions that don't fit main categories.

**Institutional differences** (Figure Y - Heatmap) reveal:

- **Academic**: 60% frame agentic AI as 'Other/Uncategorized'
- **Consulting**: 59% frame agentic AI as 'Other/Uncategorized'
- **Policy**: 48% frame agentic AI as 'Other/Uncategorized'
- **Industry**: 56% frame agentic AI as 'Other/Uncategorized'

**Key insight**: The taxonomy exposes conceptual fragmentation in how agentic 
AI is defined. While some actors emphasize augmentation (copilots), others 
stress full autonomy (autonomous workers) or systemic complexity (orchestrators). 
This definitional ambiguity poses challenges for standardization and may lead 
to misaligned adoption strategies across organizations.

**Table 1** (see Appendix) provides the complete taxonomy with representative 
definitions from each category and source type.
