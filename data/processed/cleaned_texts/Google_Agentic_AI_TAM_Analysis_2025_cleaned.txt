industries kevin ichhpurani president global partner ecosystem channels google cloud sshhaappinign gth eth fuet ufureture executive summary agentic ai represents a critical leap forward in ai advancement offering novel capabilities to tackle deeply entrenched industry pain points that enterprises have faced for years this wave of innovation is not just about improving productivity agents will enable a fundamental reimagination of enterprise workflows making businesses faster more adaptive and better attuned to customer needs in an agentic world ai agents will therefore unlock value in nearly every industry and workflow whether it is streamlining error-prone claims adjudication in insurance proactively managing inventory misalignments in industrials delivering hyper-personalized experiences at scale in retail or accelerating analytical processes during pharmaceutical drug discovery as a result agentic ai can structurally redefine how enterprises generate value and compete enterprises are already seeing the transformative potential of agentic ai with several proof points quickly emerging today more than of enterprises report interest in deploying agentic ai solutions within the next three years according to bcg s most recent it buyer pulse check and software companies public filings are mentioning agentic ai times more today compared to a year ago this trend is further underscored by the fact that the largest enterprise software vendors are treating agentic ai as a strategic priority as evidenced by recent product launches and strategic acquisitions to support their agentic ai ambitions given this context the partner ecosystem has an immense opportunity to help enterprises realize the value that agents can bring in total agentic ai represents a potential 1t market opportunity for agentic ai services globally with 350b to 450b in the u s alone a figure that surpasses the estimated 320b u s spend on traditional services today and if agentic ai follows a similar trajectory to cloud computing we expect 300b to 600b of the global services opportunity to be realized by - though likely a conservative timeline given the current momentum and pace of adoption within this landscape distinct value pools are fast emerging where partners can deliver outsized impact through agentic ai deployment therefore partners must act quickly to capture the significant opportunity ahead shaping the future partners must also embrace their increasingly important role as long- the future of term partners to enterprises driving initiatives that closely align with agentic ai will be top-of-the-house business objectives to that end more onus will be placed on them to fundamentally redesign traditional business shaped by those processes around agents and as agentic deployments scale partners who lead partners will be expected to deliver new forms of ongoing support including agentic fleet orchestration or agent evaluation measurement this who act decisively evolution in responsibility will open up new opportunities for partners now will not just to explore alternative monetization models including transaction- based outcome-based and saas-like recurring fee structures participate in this as a continued signal of a partner-first approach google cloud evolution they will equip partners with resources to capitalize on this opportunity will define the providing differentiated market intelligence access to our enterprise customer base and a robust ecosystem of cutting-edge agentic category tools to that end google has already introduced a number of capabilities enabling the partner ecosystem to jump-start the agentic ai transformation journey for customers at the beginning of the journey customers lack awareness and want to see value early partners can run discovery workshops with google in the room to help their customers evaluate agent use cases as well as quickly create agent prototypes for pitches using vertex ai and its family of cutting-edge multi-modal gemini models during the build stage many enterprises worry if their data pipeline is sufficiently ready partners can use bigquery s ai tools and modern connectors across systems to quickly activate agents with less structured data than needed previously finally as agentic solutions scale driving user adoption in a productive and sustainable manner is key partners can help establish the right change management and agent lifecycle habits for their clients leveraging training and domain expertise available within the google cloud ecosystem these resources serve as a powerful starting point further enhanced by industry-leading ai research from deepmind world- class tpu infrastructure and a strong commitment to open-source collaboration through initiatives like the agent development kit adk and the agent2agent a2a protocol this holistic approach combined with co-innovation programs and partner support is designed to fuel your success shaping the future understanding agentic ai the next frontier sshhaappinign gth eth fuet ufureture agentic ai unlocks the scripts and often struggled when they were faced with changes or unexpected conditions full power of ai separately the rise of generative ai gen ai introduced a powerful tool for unstructured recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence creative tasks its ability to perform with ai

can cloud s state of ai infrastructure autonomously reason make decisions report of organizations are using or and take action to achieve specific goals experimenting with it however using gen ai by leveraging the latest ai models agentic alone to transform core business processes systems can go beyond simple task execution and deliver clear roi has proven challenging like text generation to independently manage complex processes and interact directly with agentic ai overcomes these limitations by business software combining the reasoning power of gen ai with the ability to take action in business this makes agentic ai particularly suited for systems agents can handle complex multi- real-world business challenges an ai agent can step workflows learn from outcomes and monitor its environment understand changing adapt to new information all autonomously contexts create plans and execute them this allows enterprises to move beyond across different digital systems all without simple task automation and begin constant human supervision this allows them redesigning core processes to handle complex multi-step workflows and deliver tangible business outcomes in a way this step-change in capability has meaningful that previous automation and ai could not implications for how enterprises run taking a real-world example in the context of insurance true paradigm shift not claims adjudication rpa has long struggled with exceptions such as interpreting just automation unstructured claims descriptions or dealing with ambiguity generated by incomplete various debates persist about whether documentation often escalating cases agents are simply a new form of automation when exact conditions aren t met agentic or something much greater the facts offer ai transforms this agents can utilize gen ai clear support for the latter to extract relevant details from multimodal enterprises experienced benefits from inputs then validate them against policy rules the first evolution of business process and member history and retrieve supporting automation commonly known today as documents without relying on rigid logic it robotic process automation rpa rpa bots moves beyond simple auto-adjudication by gave enterprises a way to automate highly proactively coordinating with other systems structured repetitive tasks within stable to gather missing documents and assess risk environments they followed predefined from multimodal data an agent can then shaping the future orchestrate the full end-to-end resolution from autonomously processing a wider scope of claims to initiating payment significantly improving straight- through processing rates and freeing up specialists for high-judgment work alternatively consider personalization in marketing gen ai excels at creating personalized content elements e g unique emails and ad call-to-actions or even distinct ai-rendered images to suit individual preferences however gen ai struggles to orchestrate entire individual customer journeys or dynamically adapt in real-time without marketing teams manually defining intricate journey rules and campaign parameters agentic ai can harness gen ai capabilities to autonomously manage hyper-personalization it builds and refines individual profiles from online patterns purchases data and customer-provided data uses gen ai for unique n-of- content creation and crucially determines the optimal timing sequence and channels for interactions across the full journey this enables truly adaptive optimized marketing experiences at scale examples like

building from this foundation of addressable tasks we then estimate the associated application layer market based on the value delivered to enterprises and crucially the associated si services opportunity across industries please see the appendix for a detailed view of our methodology the potential timing for adoption while the value pools discussed earlier outline a long-run full potential value expressed in dollars we recognize that the actual trajectory and timeframes for realizing this potential are subject to considerable uncertainty the evolution of the cloud market provides a relevant albeit imperfect analog for how the agentic ai market may play out having also represented a structural technology shift for enterprises forrester idc and gartner suggest cloud spend has grown from 20b in to 400b in real terms growing at p a over a timeframe of years and even faster at p a between and across - years cloud revenues scaled from 20b to 400b with fastest growth during

ceo q4fy25 earnings conference call when cloud started adoption took longer due to the size of transformation and upskilling needed this infrastructure is already in place for agentic and has been fast-tracked by covid google cloud partner additionally the speed of ai momentum seen in the market suggests agentic adoption could follow a faster timeline than cloud further pulling forward the timeline for partners and giving good reason to be optimistic that substantial value is at play for partners within the next to years for instance stripe found that ai startups are building businesses faster the top ai companies on stripe in took months to arr vs months for previous waves of saas companies shaping the future regional market dynamics many of our current the characteristics and make-up of the agentic opportunities are in north ai market vary by region due to differences in industry exposure and the mix of service-based vs america where new tech manufacturing-based economies adoption seems to start first north america north america represents the largest this is driven by the speed potential si value pool globally driven by a highly professionalized workforce this market is driven by and size of investments in technology tmeg and the financial services insurance the us and lower regulatory sectors which together account for nearly of the hurdles europe has been regional value pool the technical maturity of enterprises in this region along with organizational readiness has laid a - months out and specific strong foundation for embracing ai-driven transformation pockets of demand have interest in agentic ai use cases spans both front- and back- also picked up in apac office domains given the concentration of large-scale enterprises with the resources technical maturity and google cloud partner innovation ambition to invest in ai non-exhaustively we have observed interest in the personalization of customer experiences and the augmentation of backend processes emea emea also features a relatively professionalized workforce compared to north america the region some sub-verticals across exhibits a more balanced distribution across industries emea apac and latam are though there is a hotspot in the auto industrial sector which accounts for around of the total si services cutting edge and quick to value pool this industrial diversity shapes the kinds of market for example banking operational challenges sis are brought in to solve and payments in europe data maturity driven by heightened awareness of gdpr and latam is a progressive and customer data governance has created favorable conditions for ai exploration especially in content market with a lot of digital generation and personalized engagement though it also native customers or fashion generates caution players in europe who are japac the si value pool in japac is more heavily exploring broader customer weighted toward tasks performed by clerical sales and trade worker roles this composition contrasts with more experience-focused agentic service-based economies and signals a stronger need for ai use cases ai solutions that can address high-volume task-based functions vertically the region s value is concentrated in google cloud industry retail cpg auto industrial and financial services which solution leader shaping the future together account for around of the opportunity this creates a natural fit for sis to support operationally intensive industries especially those with distributed workforces and manual frontline processes there are relatively high levels of data readiness and executive ambition across key japac markets particularly in australia many retailers in australia are actively exploring how ai can drive unified customer interactions and improve responsiveness across channels at scale latam the latam si value pool is smaller and is driven by more of a mixed labor base with the types of roles being more diverse than other regions of the potential si value pool is driven by augmentation of tasks performed by managers or professionals with another by technicians or clerical and sales workers latam has a higher concentration of value in the retail cpg public sector and auto industrial verticals gartner gartner forecasts worldwide genai spending to reach billion in stripe annual letter compared to top saas companies in shaping the future the strategic imperative for partners how services will evolve in an agentic world sshhaappinign gth eth fuet ufureture the sheer scale of the agentic ai opportunity makes it a strategic imperative for sis to reshape how they deliver monetize and differentiate a potential 1t opportunity for agentic ai services is more than just a new service line it reinforces the urgency for sis to undertake a strategic rethink act fast and capture the opportunity ahead observing from the sidelines leaves untapped value on the table to navigate this transition successfully there are five key themes that sis must consider when defining their strategic roadmap in the agentic era evolving the si delivery model beyond just technical execution in the traditional world sis helped customers solve large-scale execution questions like how can enterprises migrate on-prem sap to the cloud however in the agentic world customer expectations of sis will evolve towards helping them leverage agents to solve fundamental business issues this requires sis to more deeply understand and potentially redesign business processes to realize the value of agents this evolution has implications for how sis deliver work over time greater emphasis on upfront design work in the near term sis need to invest time upfront to understand business processes and potentially design new organization processes that embed agents into workflows in order to realize full value potential more prototypes not slides customers will increasingly expect prototypes that work early on which will cause sis to shift from delivering slides to delivering working code in turn this will enable sis to show value early which strengthens their long-term positioning finding the change leader to help drive implementation while technical implementation remains a key element sis over time will need to become more savvy in helping customers drive adoption as agents move into production environments crucially this includes proactive change management identifying change leaders outlining adoption roadmaps and managing production deployment risks sis may take this opportunity to build the capability to do this work themselves or work hand-in-hand with other consulting partners evolution in maintenance support needs while core maintenance capabilities will remain relevant we expect incorporation of new agent-specific elements that have never been seen before such as orchestrating multi-agent workflows evaluating and measuring agent performance and refreshing agent knowledge to prevent model drift all performed over time on a recurring basis shaping the future based on traction in the last months we fear clients will only use agents to enhance current workflows not reimagine them this is where sis need to help them to unlock true full value google cloud partner we have moved away from slides and now bring agent prototypes built with speed using google tools and synthetic data this proves roi instantly for clients and helps get a poc in under weeks vs - weeks google cloud partner as we create our library of agents we expect customers to remain sticky and continue to invest in implementation and maintenance for continued access to 1000s of agents and best cross-industry practices to learn from both of these can save millions for enterprises google cloud partner

match the nature of agentic value creation agentic ai will open up the opportunity for sis to test different monetization structures catering to varying levels of si and enterprise risk appetite this opportunity is a unique juncture to refresh pricing strategies enabled by the step-change in both the magnitude of opportunity that agentic ai brings and the shift in work mix and knowledge base it requires while we believe that traditional time and material and fixed fee models will continue as key structures for predictable transparent pricing sis should use this opportunity to consider other monetization options that align with value delivery to customers recurring software saas-like pricing sis may be able to embody their unique domain expertise into productized agentic solutions if sis are able to resell their agentic solution as reusable ip potentially discoverable and accessible via marketplace a recurring saas-like monetization can drive customer stickiness and waves of additional value non-recurring transaction-based e g one-time fee per agent deployed this model allows clients to purchase specific ai capabilities or digital workers on demand for discrete tasks offering cost control for well-defined non-continuous needs distinct from ongoing service subscriptions outcome-based pricing agents can inherently drive measurable business outcomes when deployed end-to-end for such scenarios sis should consider outcome-based pricing when a feasible roi exists with the risk upside vs risk balance sis must weigh monetization innovation i e outcome-based and recurring models and solution repeatability against customers appetite for predictable transparent pricing illustrative non-exhaustive outcome-based recurring software saas-like pricing e g per agent per interaction per use complexity and risk of delivery for si exhibit various monetization models exist based on the si s risk appetite using new tools to quickly reach sufficient data readiness for agentic deployment addressing how data is supplied to agentic ai is a foundational conversation with every customer though the traditional concept of data readiness is evolving the emphasis is shifting towards architecting effective data pipelines that enable ai agents to reliably access and process the diverse information that they need when they need it thankfully new gen ai-enabled tools have been built to address these needs allowing sis to quickly build knowledge maps and assemble data repositories that can be used to guide agents increasingly these repositories can include unstructured data e g documents email transcripts which was often a challenge to integrate with traditional automation approaches as a result sis must be equipped to use these tools so that they can help customers map their existing data landscape allowing them to efficiently and securely connect various datasets to ai agents this includes mapping operational data flows understanding ai data regulations which may differ by industry and geography and pinpointing key data sources such as databases apis and document repositories that can be used to guide the behavior of agents that rely on them once these data pathways are better understood sis can guide clients across a spectrum of solutions for immediate pilots pocs leveraging readily accessible client data external data e g from google s kaggle or even synthetic data can offer tactical value and help quickly validate roi modern approaches including the use of advanced connectors like the model context protocol mcp and inter-agent communication protocols like the agent2agent protocol a2a can enable faster and more seamless data access from various enterprise systems furthermore agentic systems themselves are designed to improve over time in their decision-making capabilities as they process more information while robust data governance regulatory adherence and data quality assurance remain important for building sustainable and scalable agentic ai solutions the initial barrier to entry can be lowered by focusing on smart data pipeline design and gen ai s ability to work with the data landscape as-is educating customers on these evolving data integration patterns and prerequisites will be vital shaping the future building the capabilities to scale agentic solutions from pilot to production sis will increasingly need to demonstrate core capabilities to map out existing business processes in their pre-agent state redesign these workflows to incorporate agents with or without humans in the loop utilize best-in-class enterprise ai platforms such as vertex ai to develop agents as well as set up integrations with existing data systems that are required to execute that workflow balancing efficiency optimization and broader regulatory considerations is crucial in this redesign process and can be moderated by defining clear human-agent interaction points sis investing in proprietary knowledge reusable ip such as pre-built connectors to widely used existing enterprise software custom model approaches and design patterns and strong change management capabilities will be able to accelerate the poc to deployment conversion cycle and create a long-term competitive advantage furthermore the ability to deploy these integrated solutions into production at scale is critical this requires establishing processes that enable continuous integrations suitable for the pace of agentic ai evolution rigorous testing methodologies to ensure agent reliability and sound infrastructure planning in the near-term this means arming go-to-market gtm teams with tools to educate and provide assurance to customers for instance a library of vertical use cases a set of ethical and ai regulation- compliant deployment guidances which may differ by industry and geography and roi calculators with flexible pricing and prototypes demos to bring to pitches over time customers will also need support in implementing observability tools to monitor agent accuracy efficiency and roi attribution as well as emerging agentic maintenance work such as refreshing agent knowledge to prevent model drift for continued improvement in tangible value delivered shaping the future focusing on high-value industry-specific and customer-specific use cases to drive differentiation agentic ai s applicability is vast requiring sis to prioritize use cases based on opportunity size and ease of deployment while we extensively discuss the art of the possible for each industry in the next chapter sis should consider two distinct horizons pursuing quick wins with a clear near-term fit for agents e g customer service and building towards larger transformative agentic ecosystems e g n-of-

the agentic ai application layer value pool which is the portion of value that flows to agentic ai software products and could come in many forms such as license subscription or usage fees that a customer pays distinct from the consulting implementation and maintenance fees paid to sis based on partner interviews and secondary research we estimate that the application layer could capture approximately - of the total compensation dollars that could be augmented by agentic ai job categories with high agentic addressability greater than of total job time bias toward the upper end of this range for other roles we assumed the lower end of this range based on benchmarks from bcg and salesforce case studies as well as market participant insights on past software and gen ai deployments which suggest application layer capture in the range this resulted in a total u s application layer value pool of approximately 1t shaping the future us application value pool for agentic ai by

healthcare public retail other sector cpg share of total value exhibit b estimated u s application value pool for agentic ai estimating the si services value pool finally we estimated the amount of value that can be translated from the application layer specifically to si services assuming a full potential steady state scenario as a starting point we exclude small and medium-sized businesses smbs and lower middle-market firms ftes from what remains we translate the spend on agentic applications to spend on si services to advise on implement and maintain those applications at the project level the ratio of si services to application spend can vary widely depending on the complexity customization and scope of the deployment whether agentic or otherwise case studies based on information from bcg and forrester show that si services spend can be as low as 2x the application spend for relatively simple off-the- shelf customer service agents in contrast highly tailored implementations that involve full-stack modernization or deep workflow integration such as traditional crm erp deployments and bespoke agents built from the ground up can drive si spend up to 4x the application layer this variance reflects how different each technology deployment can be depending on use case industry and enterprise readiness however when we zoom out to the market level this variance will be averaged away market estimates from sources such as gartner and idc suggest that si services spend typically lands in the range of - per of application software spend tending towards the higher end of this range when isolating for larger companies this reflects the shaping the future average mix of advisory implementation and ongoing support work that accompanies enterprise-grade software adoption with these data points in mind we use a midpoint assumption that - will be spent on si services per of agentic ai application spend this range reflects a market- level steady state balancing high- and low-intensity deployments while assuming a mix of recurring and non-recurring services in practice this means that some share of advisory and implementation work will recycle across customers and projects over time much like in the broader enterprise saas market today importantly we also exclude spend associated with job roles that have low agentification potential as these roles are less likely to require material si involvement together these assumptions yield an estimated total si services value pool of 350b to 450b in the u s based on an application layer value pool of 1t si
