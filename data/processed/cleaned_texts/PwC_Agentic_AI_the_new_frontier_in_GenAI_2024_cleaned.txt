ensuring ethical ai safeguards to drive autonomous process re engineering and enhanced decision making across all lines of business integrated effectively agentic ai can enhance efficiency lower costs improve customer experience and drive revenue growth what is agentic ai agentic ai generally refers to ai systems that possess the capacity to make autonomous decisions and take actions to achieve specific goals with limited or no direct human intervention  key aspects of agentic ai autonomy agentic ai systems goal oriented behaviour these environment interaction an can operate independently ai agents are designed to pursue agentic ai interacts with its making decisions based on their specific objectives optimising surroundings perceiving changes programming learning and their actions to achieve the and adapting its strategies environmental inputs desired outcomes accordingly learning capability many workflow optimisation agentic multi agent and system agentic ai systems employ ai agents enhance workflows and conversation agentic ai machine learning or business processes by integrating facilitates communication reinforcement learning techniques language understanding with between different agents to to improve their performance over reasoning planning and construct complex workflows it time decision making this involves can also integrate with other optimising resource allocation systems or tools such as email improving communication and code executors or search collaboration and identifying engines to perform a variety of automation opportunities tasks environment learning interaction capability workflow goal oriented optimisation behaviour multi agent and system autonomy conversation evolution to multimodal genai agents in ai the only constant is change embrace a culture of perpetual innovation the journey of agentic frameworks began as simple rule based systems designed to perform specific tasks over time these systems have evolved into sophisticated multimodal agents capable of processing and integrating information from various sources such as text images and audio multimodality capabilities allow ai agents to understand employ reasoning and interact like humans enhancing their effectiveness and versatility to solve a wide range of business problems  the evolution can be broken down into three key phases      s integration of machine learning ml learning from data the integration of ml allowed agents to learn from large datasets improving their ability to make decisions and perform tasks this was a significant step forward from rule based systems as agents could now adapt to new information and improve over time natural language processing nlp enabled user interactions advances in nlp enabled agents to understand and generate human language more effectively making interactions more natural and intuitive      s introduction of multimodality combining text images and audio multimodal agents emerged capable of processing and integrating information from various sources for instance an agent could analyse a text description recognise objects in an image and understand spoken commands this multimodality made agents more versatile and capable of handling complex tasks enhanced user interactions multimodal agents could interact with users in more dynamic ways such as providing visual aids in response to text queries or understanding context from a combination of spoken and visual inputs      s   advanced autonomy and real time interactions present advanced autonomy agents can operate independently rationalise and set their own goals develop path s to attain these goals and make independent decisions without constant human intervention leveraging data from multiple sources or synthetic datasets in a multi agentic orchestration system the first set of agents focus on mimicking human behaviour e g chatgpt  o that is thinking fast to come up with solution approach while the second set of agents focus on slow reasoning e g chatgpt  o to come up with a vetted solution  combining thinking fast and slow reasoning agents can process information and make optimal decisions in real time crucial for applications like autonomous vehicles real time customer service and various mission critical business processes this autonomy makes agentic ai particularly powerful in dynamic and complex real world environments user interactions within an ethical and responsible ai controlled environment with increased capabilities there has also been a focus on ensuring that agentic systems operate ethically and responsibly considering factors such as bias transparency and accountability integration of ml     s nlp enabled user learning from data interactions integration of

attention in the fast lane of technological evolution missing the ai turn today means being outpaced tomorrow agentic ai offers significant advantages in efficiency decision making and customer interaction by automating routine tasks and providing intelligent insights agentic ai can help organisations save time reduce cost and improve overall productivity moreover organisations who adopt an agentic ai system can gain a competitive advantage by leveraging its capabilities to innovate and enhance their business operations lower cost to entry and economies of scale makes it favourable for organisations to fully harness the capabilities it offers compared to its predecessors like traditional ml and robotic process automation rpa  driven automations agentic ai systems can significantly enhance an organisation s competitive edge by automating complex workflows reducing operational costs and improving decision making processes these systems are designed to adapt to changing business environments driving higher productivity and enabling organisations to stay competitive for example agentic ai can predict market trends and customer preferences allowing businesses to tailor their strategies proactively this adaptability not only improves efficiency but also fosters innovation giving companies a significant edge over competitors  moreover agentic ai systems can handle large volumes of data and extract actionable insights which can be used to optimise operations and enhance customer experiences by automating routine tasks these systems free up human resources to focus on more strategic initiatives thereby increasing overall organisational agility and responsiveness  enhanced decision making agentic ai systems can analyse vast amounts of data quickly and accurately providing valuable insights to inform better decision making businesses can leverage these insights to optimise revenue and operations identify market trends and make data driven decisions for instance in the financial sector ai can analyse market data to predict trends inform investment strategies and boost investment roi in retail it can streamline inventory management by predicting demand and optimising stock levels boosted efficiency and productivity agentic ai can significantly enhance business efficiency and productivity by automating routine tasks and processes this allows employees to focus on more strategic and creative activities for example in customer service agentic ai can handle common inquiries freeing up human agents to tackle more complex issues in manufacturing ai driven robots can manage repetitive tasks with precision and consistency reducing errors and increasing output improved customer experience by integrating agentic ai businesses can offer personalised and responsive customer experiences ai driven chatbots and virtual assistants can provide instant support answer queries and even recommend products based on customer preferences and dynamic interactions this improves customer satisfaction builds loyalty and drives sales for example e commerce platforms use ai to recommend products based on browsing history and purchase behaviour agentic ai systems are redefining customer service centres and are gaining popularity as a game changing capability for both government entities and private sector organisations while traditional rule based chatbots software as a service provided basic support and retrieval augmented generated rag  based chatbots enhanced human like interactions enhanced software as a service agentic ai surpasses both in terms of accuracy contextual coherence and problem solving ability in terms of accuracy rule based chatbots are limited to programmed responses causing inaccuracies when queries fall outside of predefined rules rag based chatbots depend on retrieved data that may not match user intent in contrast the novel approach of agentic ai allows it to understand nuances in language generating accurate responses even to complex or unseen queries its ability to learn from vast datasets enhances precision and adaptability making it superior for customer interactions one of the biggest limitations of chatbots has been contextual coherence rule based chatbots struggle to maintain context in extended interactions due to linear scripting leading to disjointed responses that harm customer experience rag based chatbots may produce inconsistent replies if retrieval mechanisms don t consider previous interactions whereas agentic ai s orchestration capability helps it excel at tracking conversation history understanding dialogue flow ensuring responses remain contextually appropriate and coherent significantly boosting customer engagement thus far both rule based and rag based chatbots have limited autonomous problem solving ability the former can t handle problems outside their scripts while the latter provide information but can t synthesise data and prepare the human live problem solving logic to solve complex issues across integrated sources such as crms erp or ivr systems the agentic ai performs dynamic reasoning and decision making leveraging a series of autonomous agents analysing customer issues considering multiple factors and applying learned knowledge to resolve problems more efficiently the outcome is quicker solution oriented and fluid conversations that enhance customer experience and set new standards for efficiency and responsiveness in automated customer service stnega orcim customer support agent customer support agent user issue feedback status updates experience faq agent resolution collection nth agent agent agent agent agent tnega retsam tnega rotartsehcro how to conceptualise agentic ai solutions for future business operations agentic ai business imperatives organisations managing day to day operations stand to gain significantly from agentic ai systems embracing the emerging service as a software model this innovative approach transforms manual labour into automated ai driven services rather than purchasing traditional software licences or subscribing to cloud based software as a service saas businesses can now pay for specific outcomes delivered by ai agents for example a company might employ ai customer support agents like sierra to resolve issues on their websites paying per resolution rather than maintaining a costly human support team this model allows organisations to access a wider range of services whether it s legal support from ai powered lawyers continuous cybersecurity testing by ai penetration testers or automated crm management at a fraction of the cost this not only drives efficiency but also significantly reduces operational overheads by leveraging the service as a software model businesses can automate both routine and highly specialised tasks that were once time consuming required skilled professionals and typically involved expensive software licences or cloud solutions ai applications with advanced reasoning capabilities can now handle complex tasks from software engineering to running customer care centres enabling companies to scale their operations without a proportional increase in cost this transition expands the services available to organisations of all sizes freeing them to focus on strategic priorities while ai systems manage the operational burden adopting these ai driven services positions businesses to stay competitive in an ever evolving marketplace  transitioning from copilot to autopilot models service as a software represents an outcome focused strategic shift enabling organisations to transition from their current state to operating in copilot and ultimately autopilot modes sierra for instance offers a safety net by escalating complex customer issues to human agents when necessary ensuring a seamless customer experience while not all ai solutions offer this built in fallback a common strategy is to initially deploy ai in a copilot role alongside human workers this human in the loop approach helps organisations build trust in ai capabilities over time as ai systems demonstrate their reliability businesses can confidently transition to an autopilot mode where ai operates autonomously enhancing efficiency and reducing the need for human oversight github copilot is a prime example of this assisting developers and potentially automating more tasks as it evolves outsourcing work through ai services for organisations with high operational costs outsourcing specific tasks to ai services that guarantee concrete outcomes is an increasingly attractive option take sierra for example businesses integrate sierra into their customer support systems to efficiently manage customer queries instead of paying for software licences or cloud based services they pay sierra based on the number of successful resolutions this outcome based model aligns costs directly with the results delivered allowing organisations to harness ai for specific tasks and pay solely for the outcomes achieved this shift from traditional software licences or cloud saas to service as a software is transformative in several ways targeting service profits traditional saas focused on selling user seats whereas service as a software taps into service profit pools delivering solutions that focus on specific business outcomes outcome based pricing instead of charging per user or seat service as a software adopts a pricing model based on the actual outcomes achieved directly aligning costs with results high touch delivery models service as a software offers a top down highly personalised approach providing trusted tailored solutions that meet the specific operational needs of businesses why should organisations consider early adoption and avoid being late movers early adopters late movers set industry benchmarks market struggle to catch up and miss out on and gain first mover market advantage
