approved and declassified by written procedure by the committee on digital economy policy on december upon the proposal of the oecd working party on ai governance aigo and prepared for publication by the oecd secretariat this document as well as any data and map included herein are without prejudice to the status of or sovereignty over any territory to the delimitation of international frontiers and boundaries and to the name of any territory city or area note to delegations this document is also available on o n e members partners under the reference code dsti cdep aigo final the use of this work whether digital or print is governed by the terms and conditions to be found at oecd oecd artificial intelligence papers explanatory memorandum on the updated oecd definition of an ai system acknowledgements the oecd explanatory memorandum on the updated oecd definition of an ai system complements the revised definition of an ai system and provides further technical background while the definition is necessarily short and concise its application in practice depends on a range of complex and technical considerations the explanatory memorandum aims to support all adherents to the oecd ai principles for better implementation the report was prepared by karine perset head of the artificial intelligence unit in the oecd digital economy policy division with support from lucia russo luis aranda yuki yokomori and gallia daor and under the guidance of audrey plonk deputy director of the oecd science technology and innovation directorate the aigo meetings leading up to the agreement on the updated definition of an ai system and on the explanatory memorandum were chaired by marco alexander breit from germany and juraj  orba from slovakia the report benefitted greatly from the inputs of marko grobelnik expert researcher at the ai lab of slovenia s jo ef stefan institute jsi and from stuart russel professor of computer science university of california berkeley the report also benefitted greatly from the inputs of the delegations participating in the working party on ai governance among many the drafting team wishes to thank jesse dunietz tatjana evans emilia gomez samo

their engagement oecd artificial intelligence papers explanatory memorandum on the updated oecd definition of an ai system background and updated definition of an ai system in the oecd recommendation on ai this document contains clarifications to the definition of an ai system contained in the oecd recommendation on ai the ai principles oecd to support their continued relevance and technical soundness on november april july september and october aigo delegates and other technical experts discussed clarifications to the definition in dedicated sessions and workshops at a joint session of the working party on ai governance and the committee on digital economy policy of october the committee agreed to transmit the revised definition to the oecd council for adoption on november these updates are the first of two steps to review the implementation dissemination and continued relevance of the recommendation required by the council at the five year mark of their adoption the goal of the definition of an ai system in the oecd recommendation is to articulate what is considered to be an ai system for the purposes of the recommendation the review and revision of the definition was undertaken earlier than the rest of the review due to its fundamental importance to the review process earlier consideration also endeavoured to support broad alignment of the definitions of ai systems in several ongoing processes in the european union japan and other jurisdictions and organisations that are seeking to improve governance of ai the second part of the review i e the full report on the implementation dissemination and continued relevance of the recommendation was discussed by aigo and cdep starting in fall the oecd definition of an ai system contained in the oecd ai principles oecd oecd built on the conceptual view of ai detailed in artificial intelligence a modern approach russell and norvig it read an ai system is a machine based system that can for a given set of human  defined objectives make predictions recommendations or decisions influencing real or virtual environments ai systems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy the text above is replaced with the following updated definition an ai system is a machine based system that can for a given set of human defined explicit or implicit objectives infers from the input it receives how to generate outputs such as makes predictions content recommendations or decisions that can influencinge physical real or virtual environments different ai systems are designed to operate with varying in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment the updated definition reads as follows an ai system is a machine based system that for explicit or implicit objectives infers from the input it receives how to generate outputs such as predictions content recommendations or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments different ai systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment oecd artificial intelligence papers explanatory memorandum on the updated oecd definition of an ai system in addition to updating the definition slightly the present explanatory memorandum on the definition of an ai system contains information to help to interpret the definition by adding more information on how ai systems are built and operate it builds on expert input on the oecd classification framework oecd and on the work of the oecd expert group on what is ai undertaken in   oecd this explanatory memorandum will a ccompanies the recommendation but is not part of it and is not be submitted to the council for adoption oecd artificial intelligence papers explanatory memorandum on the updated oecd definition of an ai system explanatory memorandum an ai system is a machine based system that for explicit or implicit objectives infers from the input it receives how to generate outputs such as predictions content recommendations or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments different ai systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment topics typically encompassed by the term ai topics typically encompassed by the term ai and in the definition of an ai system include categories of techniques such as machine learning and knowledge based approaches and application areas such as computer vision natural language processing speech recognition intelligent decision support systems intelligent robotic systems as well as the novel application of these tools to various domains ai technologies are developing at a rapid pace and additional techniques and applications will likely emerge in the future the oecd definition aims to be flexible by reflecting a broad understanding of ai and actors using this definition are encouraged to exercise judgement on its relevant scope depending on the context it is being used in role of humans autonomy and adaptiveness regarding the role of humans an ai system s objective setting and development can always be traced back to a human who originates the ai system development process even when the objectives are implicit however some types of ai systems can develop implicit sub objectives and sometimes set objectives for other systems human agency autonomy and oversight vis   vis ai systems are critical values in the oecd ai principles that depend on the context of ai use the oecd definition of an ai system intentionally does not address the issue of liability and responsibility for ai systems and their potentially harmful effects which ultimately rests with humans and does not in any way pre determine or pre empt regulatory choices made by individual jurisdictions in that regard ai system autonomy contained in both the original and the revised definition of an ai system means the degree to which a system can learn or act without human involvement following the delegation of autonomy and process automation by humans human supervision can occur at any stage of the ai system lifecycle such as during ai system design data collection and processing development verification validation deployment or operation and monitoring some ai systems can generate outputs without these outputs being explicitly described in the ai system s objective and without specific instructions from a human adaptiveness contained in the revised definition of an ai system is usually related to ai systems based on machine learning that can continue to evolve after initial development the system modifies its behaviour through direct interaction with input and data before or after deployment examples include a speech recognition system that adapts to an individual s voice or a personalised music recommender system ai systems can be trained once periodically or continually and operate by inferring patterns and relationships in data through such training some ai systems may develop the ability to perform new forms of inference not initially envisioned by their programmers oecd artificial intelligence papers explanatory memorandum on the updated oecd definition of an ai system figure illustrative simplified overview of an ai system a build phase pre deployment b use phase post deployment source oecd note this figure presents only one possible relationship between the development and deployment phases in many cases the design and training of the system may continue in downstream uses for example deployers of ai systems may fine tune or continuously train models during operation which can significantly impact the system s performance and behaviour environment or context an environment or context in relation to an ai system is an observable or partially observable space perceived using data and sensor inputs and influenced through actions through actuators the environments influenced by ai systems can be physical or virtual and include environments describing aspects of human activity such as biological signals or human behaviour sensors and actuators are either humans or components of machines or devices ai system objectives ai system objectives can be explicit or implicit  for example they can belong to the following categories which may overlap in some systems explicit and human defined where the developer encodes the objective directly into the system e g through an objective function examples of systems with explicit objectives include simple classifiers game playing systems reinforcement learning systems combinatorial problem solving systems planning algorithms and dynamic programming algorithms implicit in typically human specified rules rules dictate the action to be taken by the ai system according to the current circumstance for example a driving system might have a rule if the traffic light is red stop however these systems underlying objectives such as compliance with the law or avoiding accidents are not explicit even though they are typically human specified implicit in training data where the ultimate objective is not explicitly programmed but incorporated through training data and a system architecture that learns to emulate those data e g rewarding large language models for generating a plausible response not fully known in advance some examples include recommender systems that use reinforcement learning to gradually narrow down a model of individual users preferences ai systems can operate according to one or more types of objectives in addition user prompts can supplement design objectives when the system is in operation e g a specific destination supplied by the user in the case of a navigation system or prompts in large language models it can be challenging to specify explicit objectives for ai systems that implement the system s intent i e the explicit objective may result in unanticipated consequences it is often the case that spelling out the oecd artificial intelligence papers explanatory memorandum on the updated oecd definition of an ai system designer s true objectives can be too difficult or result in a system that is inefficient thus the objectives used to create the systems are often higher level objectives the degree to which the explicit objective and the designers intent differ is sometimes referred to as misalignment input including data input is used both during development and after deployment input can take the form of knowledge rules and code humans put into the system during development or data humans and machines can provide input during development input is leveraged to build ai systems e g with machine learning that produces a model from training data and or human input input is also used by a system in operation for instance to infer how to generate outputs input can include data relevant to the task to be performed or take the form of for example a user prompt or a search query building ai systems and models prior to deployment an ai system is typically built by combining one or more models developed manually or automatically e g with reasoning and decision making algorithms based on machine and or human inputs data machine learning is a set of techniques that allows machines to improve their performance and usually generate models in an automated manner through exposure to training data which can help identify patterns and regularities rather than through explicit instructions from a human the process of improving a system s performance using machine learning techniques is known as training symbolic or knowledge based ai systems typically use logical and or probabilistic representations which may be human generated or machine generated to infer outputs such as predictions and decisions these representations rely on explicit descriptions of variables and of their interrelations for example a system that reasons about manufacturing processes might have variables representing factories goods workers vehicles machines and so on in addition symbolic ai may use machine learning for example inductive logic programming learns symbolic logical representations from data and decision tree learning learns symbolic logical rules in the form of a tree of logical conditions although different interpretations of the word model exist in this document an ai model is a core component of an ai system used to make inferences from inputs to produce outputs it is important to note that while the parameters of an ai model change during the build phase they usually remain fixed after deployment once the build phase has concluded however some ai systems composed of model s built using machine learning methods can continue to adapt after the initial build phase improving their performance by interacting directly with new input and data furthermore ai systems may be periodically updated retrained re tested and re deployed as new versions a model is defined as a physical mathematical or otherwise logical representation of a system entity phenomenon process or data in the iso iec standard ai models include among others statistical models and various kinds of input output functions such as decision trees and neural networks an ai model can represent the transition dynamics of the environment allowing an ai system to select actions by examining their possible consequences using the model ai models can be built manually by human programmers or automatically through for example unsupervised supervised or reinforcement machine learning techniques in addition although ai systems are constructed using machine learning methods or logic  and knowledge  based approaches they generally do not have access to any training data after deployment oecd artificial intelligence papers explanatory memorandum on the updated oecd definition of an ai system inferring how to generate outputs the concept of inference generally refers to the step in which a system generates an output from its inputs typically after deployment when performed during the build phase inference in this sense is often used to evaluate a version of a model particularly in the machine learning context in the context of this explanatory memorandum infer how to generate outputs should be understood as also referring to the build phase of the ai system in which a model is derived from inputs data output s the output s generated by an ai system generally reflect different functions performed by ai systems ai system outputs generally belong to the broad categories of recommendations predictions and decisions these categories correspond to different levels of human involvement with decisions being the most autonomous type of output the ai system affects its environment directly or directs another entity to do so and predictions the least autonomous for example a driver assist system might predict that a pixel region in its camera input is a pedestrian it might recommend braking or it might decide to apply the brake generative ai systems that produce content including text image audio and video have gained significant momentum although one could for example view the generation of text as a sequence of decisions to output particular words or predictions of words that would be likely to appear in a specific context content generation systems have become such an important class of ai systems that they are included as their own output category in the present revised definition box different types of tasks performed by ai systems outputs generally reflect different tasks or functions performed by ai systems they include but are not limited to recognition identifying and categorising data e g image video audio and text into specific classifications as well as image segmentation and object detection event detection connecting data points to detect patterns as well as outliers or anomalies forecasting using past and existing behaviours to predict future outcomes personalisation developing a profile of an individual and learning and adapting its output to that individual over time interaction support interpreting and creating content to power conversational and other interactions between machines and humans possibly involving multiple media such as voice text and images goal driven optimisation finding the optimal solution to a problem for a cost function or predefined goal and reasoning with knowledge structures inferring new outcomes that are possible even if they are not present in existing data through modelling and simulation source oecd application of the updated definition the updated definition of ai is inclusive and encompasses systems ranging from simple to complex ai represents a set of technologies and techniques applicable to many different situations specific techniques such as machine learning may raise particular considerations for policymakers such as bias transparency and explainability and some contexts of use e g decisions about public benefits may raise more significant concerns than others for that reason when applied in practice additional criteria may be needed to narrow or otherwise tailor the definition when used in a specific context oecd

systems are supplied with objectives however the ultimate human objectives e g respecting traffic rules may be higher level or more abstract than the technical objectives supplied to the system e g stopping at a red light which should serve the higher level objectives from a more technical perspective the learning process for these imitative systems relies on a formally defined loss function that measures the deviation of the system s outputs from observed human behaviour the loss function does not however express the human objectives underlying the observed behaviour this is in contrast with a reinforcement learning approach where the reward function used for training may explicitly express the humans ultimate objectives and trade offs some experts have pointed out that one type of ai system malfunction related to its input may involve a system partially or totally ignoring its input data when generating its output with respect to this sense of the word model the phrase model free as in model free reinforcement learning refers to a system that operates without a transition model for its environment but may instead use a direct policy mapping from inputs to actions a q function mapping from inputs and actions to values or some other way to choose actions in such cases the policy or q function would be an ai model in the more general sense of an input output function according to iso inference refers both to the process of reasoning to derive conclusions from known premises facts rules models features or raw data and to the result of that process in the context of ai prediction does not necessarily mean making a guess about the future the term can simply mean making a guess about an unknown value the output from known values supplied to the system the input
