understanding agentic ai iti's policy guide november promoting innovation worldwide the latest advancement of ai technology is here agentic ai agentic ai is an application of existing generative ai technology and has the potential to bring benefits to enterprises and consumers more broadly this paper is intended to unpack agentic ai including what such systems are comprised of who relevant actors in the ecosystem are and offer initial considerations for policymakers as they think through how to reap benefits and manage risks associated with agentic ai what is agentic ai while there are many different definitions that have been proposed for what constitutes an agentic ai system for the purposes of this paper we define agentic ai as a system with multi-step planning and reasoning capabilities that can autonomously query and select tools within boundaries set by the user to execute on a user-defined task or achieve an outcome autonomy in this context does not mean that all agentic ai systems operate with the same level of independence autonomy exists on a spectrum and in many instances users can set the level of autonomy of the agentic ai system within a given tool or product via design patterns the risk level of a particular agentic ai system varies depending on the level of autonomy the environment in which an agentic ai system is deployed the complexity of the goal or outcome the agentic ai system is intending to achieve and its ability to impact the environment in which it operates promoting innovation worldwide this is especially important in a policy context where the risk level matters in determining proportionate obligations we discuss this further in our policy considerations section importantly even with increased autonomy there remains a significant element of human involvement particularly in assigning tasks to the agentic ai system defining the parameters in which the system operates setting the guardrails and overseeing the execution of those tasks agentic ai systems are typically built upon general-purpose large language models llms which provide essential reasoning capabilities while many agentic ai systems rely upon general- purpose llms given their powerful reasoning capabilities not all of them follow this approach some agentic ai systems are constructed using llms that have been fine-tuned on domain-specific data for a certain task for example in the biomedical space models like biogpt pubmedbert and med-palm have been trained on a specific subset of data e g medical databases to support a targeted use case like autonomously cross- referencing patient data with the latest clinical studies to assist a doctor in identifying potential diagnoses an agentic ai system could be built on top of one of these specialized models when it comes to serving small business financial needs an agentic ai system could be built upon a model specifically trained on financial regulations and small business financial data this specialized model akin to a finserv-llm could autonomously analyze a small business financial statements cross-reference them with public databases for relevant economic indicators and business registries to reduce manual data entry and then generate tailored recommendations for identifying eligible government grants and loans the agentic ai system would then take the initiative to draft necessary application forms or compliance reports this would shift the burden of financial administration away from the entrepreneur allowing them to focus on growth while the ai secures opportunities besides llms some agentic ai systems can operate on small language models slms that are optimized for targeted domain- specific tasks while llms are best suited to handle broad reasoning and complex agent orchestration slms excel at the focused repetitive tasks performed by specialized ai agents promoting innovation worldwide what goes into an agentic ai system who is directly involved in the agentic ai value chain an agentic ai system typically comprises several components data the effectiveness and accuracy of ai systems are heavily dependent on the quality representativeness and reliability of the data they are trained on through data ai systems learn language recognize patterns and make predictions data sources vary and can include the open web enterprise and proprietary databases scientific datasets public records and artificially generated synthetic data llm or slm llms or slms are an agentic ai system s decision-making engine they provide reasoning capabilities for the agentic ai system and are the basis upon which the agentic ai system analyzes the situation presented to it and plans the steps it should take they can also delegate tasks to be executed on by the agentic ai system s tools as noted above the llm could be based upon a general-purpose llm or it could be based upon a domain-specific llm system architecture this is effectively the structure that enables the llm or slm to act as an agent it is used for the orchestration and execution of the tasks and tools that constitute the agentic workflow in particular the system architecture imbues the llm or slm with memory and provides it with the ability to pursue goals break them into steps and use tools tools an agentic ai system has access to specific tools to gather information and execute actions depending on the agentic ai system it might have access to tools like web navigation file operation running llm-written code querying and updating data email handling or keyboard or mouse control tools are accessed by agentic ai systems through standardized apis importantly underpinning any ai system is an eco-system of upstream and downstream infrastructure and technologies known as the ai technology stack that makes ai development and deployment possible this same foundational stack underpins agentic ai systems promoting innovation worldwide associated with these components of the agentic ai systems are actors data curator this is the organization that curates manages or maintains the data used to train fine-tune or operate ai models and agentic ai systems a data curator may be responsible for selecting collecting labeling cleaning and updating data to ensure it is accurate representative and compliant with applicable laws and licensing terms in some cases the data curator is the original creator of the data in others it could be a third party that licenses or aggregates datasets from multiple sources developer of the llm or slm this is the organization responsible for developing the llm or slm that provides the agentic ai system with reasoning capabilities the base model could be a general-purpose or a domain-specific llm or slm many ai models are also adding their own built-in agentic capabilities that support performing web searches to support reasoning etc in some instances the developer of the llm or slm may also be the data owner curator developer of system architecture this is the organization that develops system architecture for an ai agent in some instances the developer of the system architecture is the same as the developer of the llm or slm but in other instances it could be a different organization tool developer this is the organization or actor that develops the tools that the model accesses in order to execute on its tasks in some instances tools are not specifically designed for an agentic ai system companies that develop tools include established llm developers major software companies as well as smaller developers that specialize in a particular niche agentic ai system integrator this is the organization that assembles the model agentic architecture and tools into a cohesive system ensuring they work together reliably in some cases the integrator may also be the deployer but not always especially in enterprise contexts deployer of agentic ai system the ultimate deployer of the system who makes the choice about how to put the system into use deployers set the operational parameters for the agentic ai system actors responsible for managing and verifying credentials for agentic ai systems such actors include identity and access management iam platforms that authenticate agentic ai systems and authorize their access to data apis and systems it is important to note that these roles are not always distinct a single organization may play multiple roles in the value chain e g developing the llm or slm developing the system architecture and deploying the final agentic ai system promoting innovation worldwide benefits of agentic ai systems agentic ai systems offer numerous benefits for businesses and their customers below we highlight just a few examples of agentic ai s transformative potential to boost productivity streamline work processes and enhance security transforming public sector governance empowering advanced ai agents and agentic ai holds the potential to transform companions across consumer devices key government and public administration agentic ai enables intelligent context- layers including service delivery crisis aware assistants to operate seamlessly on response compliance policymaking and smartphones pcs wearables and vehicles procurement enhancing personalization productivity and real-time decision-making in everyday life enhancing cybersecurity as security teams race to outpace ai-wielding threat improving data analytics agentic ai actors agentic ai can save users hours of systems analyze and synthesize information manual work by completing tasks such as at large scale identifying patterns and initial detection triage or prioritization of delivering insights that inform decision alerts on their behalf agentic ai can making allow security operations center teams to focus on the most critical threats and streamlining hr agentic ai systems provide perform more advanced tasks while predictive workforce planning staffing agentic ai handles less complex issues strategies and can handle faqs manage time off payroll and administer benefits improving customer service agentic such as healthcare retirement plans career ai can streamline customer service by growth opportunities and more automating tasks like customer support dispute resolution and know-your- enhancing finance and compliance agentic customer updates such capabilities allow ai systems can audit financial transactions service and help employees focus on in real time detecting fraud and updating more complex work compliance reports promoting innovation worldwide strengthening manufacturing agentic enhancing industrial productivity agentic ai transforms industrial operations by ai systems can profoundly enhance autonomously executing complete industrial and critical infrastructure sectors manufacturing workflows with agentic by seamlessly integrating with operational ai systems collaborating across design technologies ot and functioning as planning operations and maintenance to physical ai they deliver substantial gains deliver up to productivity increases in efficiency safety and operational these agentic ai systems handle complex precision boosting productivity and tasks like production optimization resource value across manufacturing and essential allocation and predictive maintenance services while integrating with both digital and physical systems agentic ai allows for improving marketing agentic ai systems interoperability between different agents now help create personalized campaigns and third-party systems creating a unified with content creation a b testing and environment where agentic ai systems cross-channel optimization work collaboratively to optimize entire enhancing privacy agentic ai systems manufacturing processes while maintaining human oversight can minimize human error limit data access by design and act as privacy optimizing global supply chains agentic intermediaries such capabilities can help ai systems can combine high-precision shield individuals and organizations from machine learning models with real- excessive data collection access and time inventory monitoring to streamline use while still delivering personalized logistics reduce inventory management experiences costs cut unnecessary inventory stock and strengthen supply chain efficiency and resilience promoting innovation worldwide managing risk related to agentic ai systems as we introduced in our prior paper on foundation models and the ai value chain21 like other ai models and systems agentic ai systems have the potential to present new risks or in certain instances exacerbate existing risks importantly risk levels of agentic ai systems may vary by deployment context some applications present minimal risk while others require careful safeguards technology-neutral frameworks like the nist ai risk management framework remain helpful to risk management as the practices contained within can apply to multiple types of ai systems and models we discuss in more depth how such frameworks can evolve in the era of agentic ai jaggedness while llms that underpin create new privacy vulnerabilities unless agents are trained on encyclopedic volumes properly addressed further whether the of data they can exhibit jagged intelligence information is stored on a device or in cloud jagged intelligence means being highly environments it could create new attack capable in some areas but struggling surfaces for surveillance exfiltration and with simpler tasks that most humans misuse and may be legally accessible to find intuitive and can reliably solve third parties such as in the case of a court understanding these deeper characteristics order privacy-enhancing technologies like is crucial for designing robust agentic ai differential privacy and trusted execution systems because agentic ai systems often environments are especially important in chain multiple steps together an error helping to manage privacy risks in an agentic in one step based on a jagged area of ai system other tools like ethical data incompetence can cascade through the governance and provenance practices can entire workflow such a jagged failure can also play a key role in managing privacy risks compound over time leading to a sequence security vulnerabilities agentic ai systems of flawed decisions and resulting in a series like other ai systems may be vulnerable of failures to a wide range of exploits for instance privacy implications if agentic ai systems attackers can perform prompt injection are given unrestricted access to resources feeding malicious instructions to the databases or tools without necessary agent to bypass its safety measures or guardrails in place they could potentially gain unauthorized access similarly an collect store and transmit sensitive agentic ai system s underlying model could information about users interactions and be poisoned with corrupted data these behavior patterns such unrestricted risks may grow as agentic ai systems are access and accumulation of data may integrated with software environments promoting innovation worldwide apis files and iot devices if compromised accountability for decision-making in case an agentic ai system might take harmful of errors or harmful outcomes caused by actions autonomously with little or no human agentic ai systems defining accountability may oversight malign actors may also exploit become complicated depending on the level weaknesses in the models themselves or the of autonomy of the system the complexity external tools they rely upon of the technology stack that may compose an agentic ai system and their dynamic decision- cyber threat landscape implications making potential failures of agentic ai agentic ai has the potential to transform systems can erode trust in businesses and other the entire cyberattack chain by enabling the organizations deploying these models deployment of autonomous specialized agentic ai systems that work in concert value misalignment and unintended actions these purpose-built agentic ai systems are agentic ai systems might pursue goals in designed to operate independently test ways that do not align with the user s intent various attack methods execute actions and or human values such misalignment could dynamically adjust tactics based on real- happen if instructions given to the agent are time feedback forming an intelligent self- unclear or if the agent optimizes too narrowly correcting attack system the emergence greater autonomy of agentic ai systems might of agentic ai is an accelerating reality lead to a higher risk of accidents or unethical that challenges existing threat detection actions caused by this misalignment response and mitigation strategies the workplace shifts the widespread adoption rapid pace of ai development means that of agentic ai systems might shift labor and both attackers and defenders are operating skill demand in complex ways these systems in a rapidly evolving landscape where the can automate a wide range of tasks including capabilities of security vendors and malicious cognitive and white-collar functions as a actors are constantly changing general-purpose technology ai is expected malicious use agentic ai systems can be to diffuse across many industries although its misused such as for large-scale generation long-term impact on the job market remains and dissemination of disinformation scaling uncertain further research into trends in ai up offensive cyber operations or increasing adoption will help governments and industry access to expert capabilities in dual-use alike to better understand how ai systems scientific research and development including agentic ai will impact employment levels and various occupations automation bias agentic ai systems have the potential to automate repetitive or agentic ai systems capabilities and implications are yet to be fully understood along with complex tasks at the same time users may opportunities agentic ai may also pose risks develop excessive trust in these models a related to privacy security accountability and phenomenon known as automation bias lead to broader socio-economic changes many leading to poor decision-making or loss of of these risks are shared with other ai systems essential skills if agentic ai systems become but the increased autonomy and interactivity general-purpose substitutes for human effort of agentic ai systems may exacerbate them as society may face longer-term consequences adoption grows policy frameworks technical solutions to protect data and robust security including cognitive dependency and standards will be essential to ensure the workforce deskilling responsible development and deployment of agentic ai promoting innovation worldwide policy considerations as governments consider how to encourage secure and trusted use of agentic ai we continue to advocate for policies that are targeted at addressing specific harms while allowing for advances in innovation in doing so governments should evaluate both regulatory and non-regulatory approaches proceeding to regulation only in cases where gaps are identified in some instances existing regulatory regimes may already cover agentic ai because this is an evolution of ai technology our prior recommendations including those outlined in our ai accountability framework30 still apply for example even in the context of agentic ai transparency along the ai value chain consumer-facing transparency and appropriately allocating roles and responsibilities within the ai value chain are all things that any robust public policy framework should seek to incorporate these recommendations are not intended to be prescriptive and instead introduce areas that policymakers should consider in developing a framework that will appropriately support responsible development and adoption of agentic ai systems promoting adoption to promote broad adoption of agentic ai policy makers should take steps to enable deployment across the economy foster institutional capacity and support talent development develop and advance a national ai adoption strategy governments should consider developing national ai strategies that outline ways in which they will support the adoption and integration of ai including agentic ai such a strategy should outline the specific steps that governments will take to support innovation and engender adoption as a part of this governments should endeavor to identify priority sectors where adoption could yield significant societal benefit like in national security cybersecurity and fraud detection and work to explore how to promote adoption in these areas furthermore adoption strategies could also consider how adoption could support specific groups such as upskilling the workforce training small businesses and entrepreneurs to help them compete promoting innovation worldwide address practical constraints for government adoption of agentic ai we encourage governments to identify what actions can be taken under existing authorities and where new guidance or regulation may be necessary to support government adoption of agentic ai considering the rapid pace of technological change the public sector should align government contracts with commercial terms and conditions to the greatest extent practicable and leverage existing authorities to promote the use of innovative acquisition strategies doing so will ensure that the public sector can adapt to a modern acquisition environ-ment with the tools already at its disposal update and improve the government s information technology it infrastructure to prepare government data to benefit from agentic ai government it infrastructure has not kept pace with the speed of innovation governments should continue to focus on it modernization efforts to adopt modern data management practices this means replacing outdated and end-of-life technology reducing data fragmentation and consolidating and standardizing government-data sharing practices so that data is properly structured and can scale to make better use of investments in agentic ai ensure that government contract requirements promote outcomes-based approaches to enable greater adoption of agentic ai government contracts should refrain from specifying the type of technology or specific resources that must be used in performance of a contract instead governments should focus on identifying a specific outcome that may be particularly well-suited for advanced ai tools to accomplish such as improving the delivery of public benefits ai as a broad concept is already being used in many commercial applications tools and processes used by the government focusing on outcomes will enable government contracting officers to promote greater collaboration between government and industry to identify the right ai tool suited for the mission such as agentic ai leverage agentic ai to modernize and make government operations and the delivery of services more efficient governments can support it modernization efforts by leveraging the power of agentic ai to deliver simpler faster and more reliable services with the ability to automate routine and task-oriented processes that underpin many core government functions such as constituent casework network security operations etc the government can empower the federal workforce to focus on delivering more efficient services and break down barriers to the public's access to critical government resources support voluntary testing environments like regulatory sandboxes leveraging regulatory sandboxes allows innovators and businesses to develop and test new technologies in a controlled environment that is free from certain regulatory regimes or compliance processes this allows for experimentation with agentic ai promotes innovation and contributes to learning on behalf of the relevant authorities policymakers should identify where sandbox activities can occur under current law and where new authorities might be needed promoting innovation worldwide support workforce readiness to enable adoption of agentic ai as agentic ai continues to evolve governments should work with industry academia and civil society to understand its impact on job functions and highlight the skills that will be most relevant to empower the future workforce investing in workforce readiness through public-private partnerships that focus on upskilling reskilling and digital literacy is imperative some of these policies may include training sabbaticals and learning- time carve-outs as best practice offering grant or tax credits for firms that allocate protected time for ai skilling with human-oversight principles fostering trust trust is foundational to promoting adoption with that in mind policy-makers should take steps to engender trust when considering agentic ai adopt a risk-based approach tailored to the deployment context agentic ai systems should be viewed as a spectrum they can vary in their level of autonomy the tools they use and the environments in which they operate therefore assessing risks requires considering the degree of autonomy as well as the context in which an agentic ai system is deployed for example an agentic ai system that acts as a personal assistant and independently schedules personal calendar appointments may operate with the same degree of autonomy as one that manages a hospital's patient scheduling however the potential risks associated with an error in these two contexts differs significantly highlighting the importance of taking deployment context into account in risk management in seeking to appropriately manage risk policymakers should leverage existing frameworks for agentic ai governance our ai accountability framework lays out key practices that we believe are appropriate to apply to high-risk ai systems as well as to frontier ai models we encourage policymakers to reference this document in considering regulatory or legislative approaches to ai assuming existing ai regulatory and policy frameworks have been crafted in a sufficiently flexible and future-proof way they should also be applicable to agentic ai similarly existing legal regimes that address concerns related to possible harms should also apply to agentic ai indeed an entirely new and different approach is unnecessary however given some agentic ai systems degree of autonomy it may be appropriate to undertake more rigorous red-teaming and testing pre- and post-deployment of an agent system foster transparency in the agentic ai value chain policymakers should recognize that agentic ai systems are layered and therefore the behavior of the agent system is influenced not only by the base model but also by the environment in which it operates the data it uses its goal orientation and its system architecture transparency should therefore be tailored to the unique characteristics of such systems promoting innovation worldwide rather than creating new disclosure regimes from scratch policy-makers should explore how existing tools like model cards and system cards can be leveraged to communicate information about agent systems to downstream deployers system cards could be extended to reflect agent behavior s and characteristics including at a high level the ways in which the system was tested and evaluated prior to release but also potentially communicating information about human oversight permissions and the tools and system architecture incorporated as we outline in iti s transparency policy principles31 our seminal paper on ai transparency the audience for transparency matters the information that is important to communicate to a downstream actor in the ai value chain will likely differ from the type of information communicated to the end-user especially in consumer-facing settings for example it may be sufficient to provide notice to a user operating an agentic ai system that they are interacting with an ai agent system describing its role primary capabilities and known limitations at the same time for regulatory purposes developers and integrators may need to provide upon request more detailed information on the agent such as autonomy level tool access and escalation levels this dual-level design ensures meaningful transparency without overwhelming users or under-informing regulators recognize that responsibilities should be allocated based upon function and role in the agentic ai value chain as outlined above and in all iti s existing ai policy collateral the agentic ai value chain includes a variety of players each with different responsibilities stakeholders throughout the value chain play a role in ensuring that ai is developed and deployed responsibly in considering if and how to apply obligations in the context of a policy framework or other-wise policymakers should seek to apply said obligations proportionally considering what each stakeholder in the agentic ai value chain has control over understanding this allocation of responsibilities will prevent duplication and ensure that each actor is responsible for what they can meaningfully influence for example with transparency the model developer will have insight into the base model s limitations and capabilities and should communicate that information to other downstream actors the agentic ai system integrator however will have insight into the system s planning logic level of autonomy and its tool use finally the deployer of an agentic ai system will have ultimate responsibility for usage policy knowledge of the environment in which the system is deployed in the data it has access to and the human oversight mechanisms that have been put in place it is important to recognize that these roles and responsibilities are not necessarily mutually exclusive in some instances a model developer and agentic ai system integrator could be one and the same in other cases the system integrator and the deployer could be the same at the same time it is important to keep in mind that agentic ai systems behavior often emerges from complex interactions between components in ways that can make clean responsibility allocation challenging unlike traditional supply chains systems of agents can exhibit emergent behaviors from the interplay of models prompts and tools that said while we believe allocation of responsibility in a proportionate way remains imperative it may be more challenging in certain instances given the way agentic ai systems interact promoting innovation worldwide adopt a comprehensive federal privacy law implementing privacy legislation provides a unified national framework for responsible business practices it strengthens and simplifies data management practices across the economy and provides a firm foundation for advancing trustworthy ai enhance the security of agentic ai security measures may include ensuring risk- based and actionable human control and oversight implementing limitations on agentic ai capabilities e g purpose-specific entitlements on capabilities and resource access and making agentic ai actions and planning observable and verifiable further efforts may also include the use and development of best practices and promotion of commercially available solutions that help mitigate risk it may also be worth considering how to incentivize the adoption of frameworks developed for agentic ai especially as there are many security frameworks emerging across the globe which will be developed consolidated and refined over time we encourage policymakers to leverage guidance and or encourage the adoption of guidance produced by global organizations for example the coalition for secure ai published principles for secure by design agentic systems to provide practical implementation strategies that security teams can deploy promote the adoption of voluntary best practices to govern risks related to agentic ai policymakers should support the adoption of existing standards frameworks and best practices for ai risk management like nist s ai risk management framework and the iso iec series many of these frameworks remain relevant in an agentic ai context because they are technology-neutral and govern processes that said it is also worth considering if and how existing frameworks can evolve to allow organizations to better operationalize suggested practices for example developing a risk-tiering structure for agentic systems could be helpful in ensuring consistency of risk assessment across stakeholder groups this could potentially be undertaken in the form of an agentic ai profile in the context of the ai rmf because agentic ai is an evolving area best practices will simultaneously evolve as research continues and understanding matures explore the use of privacy-enhancing technologies pets and data governance and provenance standards pets such as differential privacy data minimization and secure computation can help protect user data during storage processing and transmission in parallel promoting the development of clear industry-led data governance and provenance standards can help ensure that agentic ai systems handle personal information in ways that respect individual rights and comply with applicable laws promoting innovation worldwide promote industry-backed open standards and protocols for agentic ai systems as agentic ai systems become integral to enterprise workflows they require robust mechanisms to discover authenticate and interact with external systems and other agents open industry-led standards and protocols provide the foundational layer for this interoperability much like tcp ip did for the internet while ensuring that downstream companies can effectively deploy and integrate agentic systems these open standards foster both cross-industry collaboration and healthy competition among ai providers accelerating innovation while maintaining compatibility industry-led open protocols such as mcp a2a and acp have already demonstrated their value in powering enterprise-level agentic workflows government endorsement and promotion of these open standards would encourage broader adoption drive further development and help establish the interoperability framework necessary for a thriving agentic ai ecosystem promote multistakeholder collaboration on evaluating emerging risks given the evolving nature of agentic ai systems policymakers should encourage continued collaborative research to both understand and evaluate emerging risks and ensure consistency in how these risks are measured and assessed leveraging existing multilateral forums such as the oecd or g7 can enhance multistakeholder collaboration on emerging risks and opportunities related to agentic ai previous initiatives like the hiroshima ai process have produced valuable outcomes and similar discussions could facilitate the adoption of agentic ai while effectively managing associated risks supporting the development of shared security evaluation frameworks responsible vulnerability disclosure mechanisms and interoperable standards alongside international partners such cooperation can help build collective resilience and promote the safe and ethical deployment of agentic ai systems globally additionally evaluating agentic ai systems will require the development of new or the adaptation of existing metrics those used to evaluate traditional machine learning may need to evolve to appropriately assess an agentic ai system s performance considerations should include whether the agent meets the original user request selects the most appropriate tools and understands the initial goals government industry and academia should collaborate to develop these standards and develop collaborative evaluation frameworks for agentic ai systems finally ongoing research into an agentic ai system s ability to independently pursue goals and persistently make decisions including methods for voluntarily documenting agent behavior could be a helpful area of research to support promoting innovation worldwide
