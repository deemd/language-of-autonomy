artificial intelligence index report artificial intelligence index report introduction to the ai index report welcome to the eighth edition of the ai index report the index is our most comprehensive to date and arrives at an important moment as ai s influence across society the economy and global governance continues to intensify new in this year s report are in-depth analyses of the evolving landscape of ai hardware novel estimates of inference costs and new analyses of ai publication and patenting trends we also introduce fresh data on corporate adoption of responsible ai practices along with expanded coverage of ai s growing role in science and medicine since its founding in as an offshoot of the one hundred year study of artificial intelligence the ai index has been committed to equipping policymakers journalists executives researchers and the public with accurate rigorously validated and globally sourced data our mission has always been to help these stakeholders make better-informed decisions about the development and deployment of ai in a world where ai is discussed everywhere from boardrooms to kitchen tables this mission has never been more essential the ai index continues to lead in tracking and interpreting the most critical trends shaping the field from the shifting geopolitical landscape and the rapid evolution of underlying technologies to ai s expanding role in business policymaking and public life longitudinal tracking remains at the heart of our mission in a domain advancing at breakneck speed the index provides essential context helping us understand where ai stands today how it got here and where it may be headed next recognized globally as one of the most authoritative resources on artificial intelligence the ai index has been cited in major media outlets such as the new york times bloomberg and the guardian referenced in hundreds of academic papers and used by policymakers and government agencies around the world we have briefed companies like accenture ibm wells fargo and fidelity on the state of ai and we continue to serve as an independent source of insights for the global ai ecosystem artificial intelligence index report message from the co-directors as ai continues to reshape our lives the corporate world and public discourse the ai index continues to track its progress offering an independent data-driven perspective on ai s development adoption and impact across time and geography what a year has been for ai the recognition of ai s role in advancing humanity s knowledge is reflected in nobel prizes in physics and chemistry and the turing award for foundational work in reinforcement learning the once-formidable turing test is no longer considered an ambitious goal having been surpassed by today s sophisticated systems meanwhile ai adoption has accelerated at an unprecedented rate as millions of people are now using ai on a regular basis both for their professional work and leisure activities as high-performing low-cost and openly available models proliferate ai s accessibility and impact are set to expand even further after a brief slowdown corporate investment in ai rebounded the number of newly funded generative ai startups nearly tripled and after years of sluggish uptake business adoption accelerated significantly in ai has moved from the margins to become a central driver of business value governments too are ramping up their involvement policymakers are no longer just debating ai they re investing in it several countries launched billion-dollar national ai infrastructure initiatives including major efforts to expand energy capacity to support ai development global coordination is increasing even as local initiatives take shape yet trust remains a major challenge fewer people believe ai companies will safeguard their data and concerns about fairness and bias persist misinformation continues to pose risks particularly in elections and the proliferation of deepfakes in response governments are advancing new regulatory frameworks aimed at promoting transparency accountability and fairness public attitudes are also shifting while skepticism remains a global survey in showed a notable rise in optimism about ai s potential to deliver broad societal benefits ai is no longer just a story of what s possible it s a story of what s happening now and how we are collectively shaping the future of humanity explore this year s ai index report and see for yourself yolanda gil and raymond perrault co-directors ai index report artificial intelligence index report top takeaways ai performance on demanding benchmarks continues to improve in researchers introduced new benchmarks mmmu gpqa and swe-bench to test the limits of advanced ai systems just a year later performance sharply increased scores rose by and percentage points on mmmu gpqa and swe-bench respectively beyond benchmarks ai systems made major strides in generating high-quality video and in some settings language model agents even outperformed humans in programming tasks with limited time budgets ai is increasingly embedded in everyday life from healthcare to transportation ai is rapidly moving from the lab to daily life in the fda approved ai-enabled medical devices up from just six in on the roads self-driving cars are no longer experimental waymo one of the largest u s operators provides over autonomous rides each week while baidu s affordable apollo go robotaxi fleet now serves numerous cities across china business is all in on ai fueling record investment and usage as research continues to show strong productivity impacts in u s private ai investment grew to billion nearly times china s billion and times the u k s billion generative ai saw particularly strong momentum attracting billion globally in private investment an increase from ai business usage is also accelerating of organizations reported using ai in up from the year before meanwhile a growing body of research confirms that ai boosts productivity and in most cases helps narrow skill gaps across the workforce the u s still leads in producing top ai models but china is closing the performance gap in u s - based institutions produced notable ai models compared to china s and europe s three while the u s maintains its lead in quantity chinese models have rapidly closed the quality gap performance differences on major benchmarks such as mmlu and humaneval shrank from double digits in to near parity in china continues to lead in ai publications and patents model development is increasingly global with notable launches from the middle east latin america and southeast asia the responsible ai ecosystem evolves unevenly ai-related incidents are rising sharply yet standardized rai evaluations remain rare among major industrial model developers however new benchmarks like helm safety air-bench and facts offer promising tools for assessing factuality and safety among companies a gap persists between recognizing rai risks and taking meaningful action in contrast governments are showing increased urgency in global cooperation on ai governance intensified with organizations including the oecd eu u n and african union releasing frameworks focused on transparency trustworthiness and other core responsible ai principles artificial intelligence index report top takeaways cont d global ai optimism is rising but deep regional divides remain in countries like china indonesia and thailand strong majorities see ai products and services as more beneficial than harmful in contrast optimism remains far lower in places like canada the united states and the netherlands still sentiment is shifting since optimism has grown significantly in several previously skeptical countries including germany france canada great britain and the united states ai becomes more efficient affordable and accessible driven by increasingly capable small models the inference cost for a system performing at the level of gpt- dropped over -fold between november and october at the hardware level costs have declined by annually while energy efficiency has improved by each year open-weight models are closing the gap with closed models reducing the performance difference from to just on some benchmarks in a single year together these trends are rapidly lowering the barriers to advanced ai governments are stepping up on ai with regulation and investment in u s federal agencies introduced ai-related regulations more than double the number in and issued by twice as many agencies globally legislative mentions of ai rose across countries since marking a ninefold increase since alongside growing attention governments are investing at scale canada pledged billion china launched a billion semiconductor fund france committed billion india pledged billion and saudi arabia s project transcendence represents a billion initiative ai and computer science education is expanding but gaps in access and readiness persist two-thirds of countries now offer or plan to offer k cs education twice as many as in with africa and latin america making the most progress in the u s the number of graduates with bachelor s degrees in computing has increased over the last years yet access remains limited in many african countries due to basic infrastructure gaps like electricity in the u s of k cs teachers say ai should be part of foundational cs education but less than half feel equipped to teach it industry is racing ahead in ai but the frontier is tightening nearly of notable ai models in came from industry up from in while academia remains the top source of highly cited research model scale continues to grow rapidly training compute doubles every five months datasets every eight and power use annually yet performance gaps are shrinking the elo skill score difference between the top and 10th-ranked models fell from to in a year and the top two are now separated by just the frontier is increasingly competitive and increasingly crowded artificial intelligence index report top takeaways cont d ai earns top honors for its impact on science ai s growing importance is reflected in major scientific awards two nobel prizes recognized work that led to deep learning physics and to its application to protein folding chemistry while the turing award honored groundbreaking contributions to reinforcement learning complex reasoning remains a challenge ai models excel at tasks like international mathematical olympiad problems but still struggle with complex reasoning benchmarks like planbench they often fail to reliably solve logic tasks even when provably correct solutions exist limiting their effectiveness in high-stakes settings where precision is

development industry continues to make significant investments in ai and leads in notable ai model development while academia leads in highly cited research industry s lead in notable model development highlighted in the two previous ai index reports has only grown more pronounced with nearly of notable models in compared to in originating from industry academia has remained the single leading institutional producer of highly cited top publications over the past three years china leads in ai research publication totals while the united states leads in highly influential research in china produced more ai publications and citations than any other country over the past three years u s institutions have contributed the most top--cited ai publications ai publication totals continue to grow and increasingly dominate computer science between and the total number of ai publications in venues related to computer science and other scientific disciplines nearly tripled increasing from approximately to over proportionally ai s share of computer science publications has risen from in to in the united states continues to be the leading source of notable ai models in u s -based institutions produced notable ai models significantly surpassing china s and europe s combined total of three in the past decade more notable machine learning models have originated from the united states than any other country ai models get increasingly bigger more computationally demanding and more energy intensive new research finds that the training compute for notable ai models doubles approximately every five months dataset sizes for training llms every eight months and the power required for training annually large-scale industry investment continues to drive model scaling and performance gains ai models become increasingly cheaper to use the cost of querying an ai model that scores the equivalent of gpt- on mmlu a popular benchmark for assessing language model performance dropped from per million tokens in november to just per million tokens by october gemini- -flash-8b a more than -fold reduction in approximately months depending on the task llm inference prices have fallen anywhere from to times per year artificial intelligence index report report highlights chapter research and development cont d ai patenting is on the rise between and the number of ai patents has grown steadily and significantly ballooning from to in just the last year the number of ai patents has risen as of china leads in total ai patents accounting for of all grants while south korea and luxembourg stand out as top ai patent producers on a per capita basis ai hardware gets faster cheaper and more energy efficient new research suggests that machine learning hardware performance measured in -bit floating-point operations has grown annually doubling every years price performance has improved with costs dropping per year while energy efficiency has increased by annually carbon emissions from ai training are steadily increasing training early ai models such as alexnet had modest amounts of carbon emissions at tons more recent models have significantly higher emissions for training gpt- at tons gpt- at tons and llama 405b at tons for perspective the average american emits tons of carbon per year chapter technical performance ai masters new benchmarks faster than ever in ai researchers introduced several challenging new benchmarks including mmmu gpqa and swe-bench aimed at testing the limits of increasingly capable ai systems by ai performance on these benchmarks saw remarkable improvements with gains of and percentage points on mmmu and gpqa respectively on swe-bench ai systems could solve just of coding problems in a figure that jumped to in open-weight models catch up last year s ai index revealed that leading open-weight models lagged significantly behind their closed-weight counterparts by this gap had nearly disappeared in early january the leading closed- weight model outperformed the top open-weight model by on the chatbot arena leaderboard by february this gap had narrowed to artificial intelligence index report report highlights chapter technical performance cont d the gap closes between chinese and u s models in leading american models significantly outperformed their chinese counterparts a trend that no longer holds at the end of performance gaps on benchmarks such as mmlu mmmu math and humaneval were and percentage points respectively by the end of these margins had narrowed substantially to and percentage points ai model performance converges at the frontier according to last year s ai index the elo score difference between the top and 10th-ranked model on the chatbot arena leaderboard was by early this gap had narrowed to likewise the difference between the top two models shrank from in to just in the ai landscape is becoming increasingly competitive with high-quality models now available from a growing number of developers new reasoning paradigms like test-time compute improve model performance in openai introduced models like o1 and o3 that are designed to iteratively reason through their outputs this test-time compute approach dramatically improved performance with o1 scoring on an international mathematical olympiad qualifying exam compared to gpt-4o s however this enhanced reasoning comes at a cost o1 is nearly six times more expensive and times slower than gpt-4o more challenging benchmarks are continually being proposed the saturation of traditional ai benchmarks like mmlu gsm8k and humaneval coupled with improved performance on newer more challenging benchmarks such as mmmu and gpqa has pushed researchers to explore additional evaluation methods for leading ai systems notable among these are humanity s last exam a rigorous academic test where the top system scores just frontiermath a complex mathematics benchmark where ai systems solve only of problems and bigcodebench a coding benchmark where ai systems achieve a success rate well below the human standard of high-quality ai video generators demonstrate significant improvement in several advanced ai models capable of generating high-quality videos from text inputs were launched notable releases include openai s sora stable video diffusion 3d and 4d meta s movie gen and google deepmind s veo these models produce videos of significantly higher quality compared to those from artificial intelligence index report report highlights chapter technical performance cont d smaller models drive stronger performance in the smallest model registering a score higher than on mmlu was palm with billion parameters by microsoft s phi--mini with just billion parameters achieved the same threshold the equivalent of a -fold reduction in two years complex reasoning remains a problem even though the addition of mechanisms such as chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of llms these systems still cannot reliably solve problems for which provably correct solutions can be found using logical reasoning such as arithmetic and planning especially on instances larger than those they were trained on this has a significant impact on the trustworthiness of these systems and their suitability in high-risk applications ai agents show early promise the launch of re-bench in introduced a rigorous benchmark for evaluating complex tasks for ai agents in short time-horizon settings two-hour budget top ai systems score four times higher than human experts but as the time budget increases human performance surpasses ai outscoring it two to one at hours ai agents already match human expertise in select tasks such as writing triton kernels while delivering results faster and at lower costs chapter responsible ai evaluating ai systems with responsible ai rai criteria is still uncommon but new benchmarks are beginning to emerge last year s ai index highlighted the lack of standardized rai benchmarks for llms while this issue persists new benchmarks such as helm safety and air-bench help to fill this gap the number of ai incident reports continues to increase according to the ai incidents database the number of reported ai-related incidents rose to in a record high and a increase over artificial intelligence index report report highlights chapter responsible ai cont d organizations acknowledge rai risks but mitigation efforts lag a mckinsey survey on organizations rai engagement shows that while many identify key rai risks not all are taking active steps to address them risks including inaccuracy regulatory compliance and cybersecurity were top of mind for leaders with only and of respondents respectively citing them as concerns across the globe policymakers demonstrate a significant interest in rai in global cooperation on ai governance intensified with a focus on articulating agreed-upon principles for responsible ai several major organizations including the oecd european union united nations and african union published frameworks to articulate key rai concerns such as transparency and explainability and trustworthiness the data commons is rapidly shrinking ai models rely on massive amounts of publicly available web data for training a recent study found that data use restrictions increased significantly from to as many websites implemented new protocols to curb data scraping for ai training in actively maintained domains in the c4 common crawl dataset the proportion of restricted tokens jumped from to this decline has consequences for data diversity model alignment and scalability and may also lead to new approaches to learning with data constraints foundation model research transparency improves yet more work remains the updated foundation model transparency index a project tracking transparency in the foundation model ecosystem revealed that the average transparency score among major model developers increased from in october to in may while these gains are promising there is still considerable room for improvement better benchmarks for factuality and truthfulness earlier benchmarks like halueval and truthfulqa aimed at evaluating the factuality and truthfulness of ai models have failed to gain widespread adoption within the ai community in response newer and more comprehensive evaluations have emerged such as the updated hughes hallucination evaluation model leaderboard facts and simpleqa ai-related election misinformation spread globally but its impact remains unclear in numerous examples of ai-related election misinformation emerged in more than a dozen countries and across over social media platforms including during the u s presidential election however questions remain about the measurable impacts of this problem with many expecting misinformation campaigns to have affected elections more profoundly than they did artificial intelligence index report report highlights chapter responsible ai cont d llms trained to be explicitly unbiased continue to demonstrate implicit bias many advanced llms including gpt- and claude sonnet were designed with measures to curb explicit biases but they continue to exhibit implicit ones the models disproportionately associate negative terms with black individuals more often associate women with humanities instead of stem fields and favor men for leadership roles reinforcing racial and gender biases in decision making although bias metrics have improved on standard benchmarks ai model bias remains a pervasive issue rai gains attention from academic researchers the number of rai papers accepted at leading ai conferences increased by from in to in continuing a steady annual rise since this upward trend highlights the growing importance of rai within the ai research community chapter economy global private ai investment hits record high with growth corporate ai investment reached billion in with private investment climbing and mergers and acquisitions up from the previous year the sector has experienced dramatic expansion over the past decade with total investment growing more than thirteenfold since generative ai funding soars private investment in generative ai reached billion in up from and over times higher than levels the sector now represents more than of all ai-related private investment the u s widens its lead in global ai private investment u s private ai investment hit billion in nearly times higher than china s billion and times the u k s billion the gap is even more pronounced in generative ai where u s investment exceeded the combined total of china and the european union plus the u k by billion expanding on its billion gap in use of ai climbs to unprecedented levels in the proportion of survey respondents reporting ai use by their organizations jumped to from in similarly the number of respondents who reported using generative ai in at least one business function more than doubled from in to last year artificial intelligence index report report highlights chapter economy cont d ai is beginning to deliver financial impact across business functions but most companies are early in their journeys most companies that report financial impacts from using ai within a business function estimate the benefits as being at low levels of respondents whose organizations use ai in service operations report cost savings followed by supply chain management and software engineering but most of them report cost savings of less than with regard to revenue of respondents using ai in marketing and sales report revenue gains in supply chain management and in service operations but the most common level of revenue increases is less than use of ai shows dramatic shifts by region with greater china gaining ground while north america maintains its leadership in organizations use of ai greater china demonstrated one of the most significant year-over-year growth rates with a percentage point increase in organizational ai use europe followed with a percentage point increase suggesting a rapidly evolving global ai landscape and intensifying international competition in ai implementation china s dominance in industrial robotics continues despite slight moderation in china installed industrial robots six times more than japan and times more than the united states since surpassing japan in when china accounted for of global installations its share has risen to while china continues to install more robots than the rest of the world combined this margin narrowed slightly in marking a modest moderation in its dramatic expansion collaborative and interactive robot installations become more common in collaborative robots represented a mere of all new industrial robot installations a figure that climbed to by similarly saw a rise in service robot installations across all application categories except medical robotics this trend indicates not just an overall increase in robot installations but also a growing emphasis on deploying robots for human-facing roles ai is driving significant shifts in energy sources attracting interest in nuclear energy microsoft announced a billion deal to revive the three mile island nuclear reactor to power ai while google and amazon have also secured nuclear energy agreements to support ai operations ai boosts productivity and bridges skill gaps last year s ai index was among the first reports to highlight research showing ai s positive impact on productivity this year additional studies reinforced those findings confirming that ai boosts productivity and in most cases helps narrow the gap between low- and high-skilled workers artificial intelligence index report report highlights chapter science and medicine bigger and better protein sequencing models emerge in several large-scale high-performance protein sequencing models including esm3 and alphafold were launched over time these models have grown significantly in size leading to continuous improvements in protein prediction accuracy ai continues to drive rapid advances in scientific discovery ai s role in scientific progress continues to expand while and marked the early stages of ai-driven breakthroughs brought even greater advancements including aviary which trains llm agents for biological tasks and firesat which significantly enhances wildfire prediction the clinical knowledge of leading llms continues to improve openai s recently released o1 set a new state- of-the-art on the medqa benchmark a percentage point gain over the best score posted in since late performance has improved percentage points medqa a key benchmark for assessing clinical knowledge may be approaching saturation signaling the need for more challenging evaluations ai outperforms doctors on key clinical tasks a new study found that gpt- alone outperformed doctors both with and without ai in diagnosing complex clinical cases other recent studies show ai surpassing doctors in cancer detection and identifying high-mortality-risk patients however some early research suggests that ai-doctor collaboration yields the best results making it a fruitful area of further research the number of fda-approved ai-enabled medical devices skyrockets the fda authorized its first ai-enabled medical device in by only six such devices had been approved but the number spiked to by synthetic data shows significant promise in medicine studies released in suggest that ai-generated synthetic data can help models better identify social determinants of health enhance privacy-preserving clinical risk prediction and facilitate the discovery of new drug compounds medical ai ethics publications are increasing year over year the number of publications on ethics in medical ai nearly quadrupled from to rising from in to in artificial intelligence index report report highlights chapter science and medicine cont d foundation models come to medicine in a wave of large-scale medical foundation models were released ranging from general-purpose multimodal models like med-gemini to specialized models such as echoclip for echocardiology visionfm for ophthalmology and chexagent for radiology publicly available protein databases grow in size since the number of entries in major public protein science databases has grown significantly including uniprot pdb and alphafold this expansion has important implications for scientific discovery ai research recognized by two nobel prizes in ai-driven research received top honors with two nobel prizes awarded for ai-related breakthroughs google deepmind s demis hassabis and john jumper won the nobel prize in chemistry for their pioneering work on protein folding with alphafold meanwhile john hopfield and geoffrey hinton received the nobel prize in physics for their foundational contributions to neural networks chapter policy and governance u s states are leading the way on ai legislation amid slow progress at the federal level in only one state-level ai-related law was passed increasing to by in the past year alone that number more than doubled to while proposed ai bills at the federal level have also increased the number passed remains low governments across the world invest in ai infrastructure canada announced a billion ai infrastructure package while china launched a billion fund to boost semiconductor production france committed billion to ai infrastructure india pledged billion and saudi arabia s project transcendence includes a billion investment in ai across the world mentions of ai in legislative proceedings keep rising across countries ai mentions in legislative proceedings increased by in rising to from in since the total number of ai mentions has grown more than ninefold artificial intelligence index report report highlights chapter policy and governance cont d ai safety institutes expand and coordinate across the globe in countries worldwide launched international ai safety institutes the first emerged in november in the u s and the u k following the inaugural ai safety summit at the ai seoul summit in may additional institutes were pledged in japan france germany italy singapore south korea australia canada and the european union the number of u s ai-related federal regulations skyrockets in ai-related regulations were introduced more than double the recorded in these regulations came from unique agencies twice the agencies that issued them in u s states expand deepfake regulations before only five states california michigan washington texas and minnesota had enacted laws regulating deepfakes in elections in more states including oregon new mexico and new york introduced similar measures additionally by states had passed regulations targeting deepfakes chapter education access to and enrollment in high school computer science cs courses in the u s has increased slightly from the previous school year but gaps remain student participation varies by state race and ethnicity school size geography income gender and disability cs teachers in the u s want to teach ai but do not feel equipped to do so despite the of cs teachers who agree that using ai and learning about ai should be included in a foundational cs learning experience fewer than half of high school cs teachers feel equipped to teach ai two-thirds of countries worldwide offer or plan to offer k cs education this fraction has doubled since with african and latin american countries progressing the most however students in african countries have the least amount of access to cs education due to schools lack of electricity artificial intelligence index report report highlights chapter education cont d graduates who earned their master s degree in ai in the u s nearly doubled between and while increased attention on ai will be slower to emerge in the number of bachelor s and phd degrees the surge in master s degrees could indicate a developing trend for all degree levels the u s continues to be a global leader in producing information technology and communications ict graduates at all levels spain brazil and the united kingdom follow the u s as top producers at various levels while turkey boasts the best gender parity chapter public opinion the world grows cautiously optimistic about ai products and services among the nations surveyed by ipsos in both and saw an increase in the proportion of people who believe ai products and services offer more benefits than drawbacks globally the share of individuals who see ai products and services as more beneficial than harmful has risen from in to in the expectation and acknowledgment of ai s impact on daily life is rising around the world two thirds of people now believe that ai-powered products and services will significantly impact daily life within the next three to five years an increase of percentage points since every country except malaysia poland and india saw an increase in this perception since with the largest jumps in canada and germany skepticism about the ethical conduct of ai companies is growing while trust in the fairness of ai is declining globally confidence that ai companies protect personal data fell from in to in likewise fewer people today believe that ai systems are unbiased and free from discrimination compared to last year regional differences persist regarding ai optimism first reported in the ai index significant regional differences in ai optimism endure a large majority of people believe ai-powered products and services offer more benefits than drawbacks in countries like china indonesia and thailand while only a minority share this view in canada the united states and the netherlands artificial intelligence index report report highlights chapter public opinion cont d people in the united states remain distrustful of self-driving cars a recent american automobile association survey found that of people in the u s fear self-driving cars and only trust them although the percentage who expressed fear has declined from its peak of it remains higher than in there is broad support for ai regulation among local u s policymakers in of local u s policymakers spanning township municipal and county levels agreed that ai should be regulated up significantly from in support was stronger among democrats than republicans though both registered notable increases over ai optimism registers sharp increase among countries that previously showed the most skepticism globally optimism about ai products and services has increased with the sharpest gains in countries that were previously the most skeptical in great britain germany the united states canada and france were among the least likely to view ai as having more benefits than drawbacks since then optimism has grown in these countries by and respectively workers expect ai to reshape jobs but fear of replacement remains lower globally of respondents agree that ai will change how individuals do their job in the next five years however a smaller subset of respondents believe that ai will replace their jobs in the next five years sharp divides exist among local u s policymakers on ai policy priorities while local u s policymakers broadly support ai regulation their priorities vary the strongest backing is for stricter data privacy rules retraining for the unemployed and ai deployment regulations however support drops significantly for a law enforcement facial recognition ban wage subsidies for wage declines and universal basic income ai is seen as a time saver and entertainment booster but doubts remain on its economic impact global perspectives on ai s impact vary while
