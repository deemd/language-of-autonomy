development report box the many ways generative artificial intelligence differs from classical programming generative ai differs from classical programming in many subtle ways outputs in classical programming follow from instruction to the machine in a sequence of specific and fully certain actions that lead the machine to always produce the same output given the same inputs deterministic outputs but with generative artificial intelligence ai for each input the machine probabilistically predicts an output that is based on its training data and what its algorithm was optimized to do and that cannot be known in advance with full certainty in most current generative ai applications stochastic outputs using the same prompt to a large language model will not always generate the same output making the most out of tasks performed by a large language model depends on the prompt with as a result prompt engineering emerg- ing as a new task for humans other approaches supplement prompt engineering such as retrieval- augmented generation in which external knowledge retrieved through a web search engine for instance helps the model generate more accurate and reliable responses or chain- of-thought prompting which instructs large language models to think step-b y-step but even if these approaches improve large language model performance in some tasks they also reduce it in others generative ai often hallucinates yielding plausible sounding but factually wrong outputs contradictory statements or factually correct but irrelevant statements generative ai outputs do not emanate from causal sequencing based on things such as basic logic8 and so often fail to give correct answers to slightly changed prompts large language models also struggle with simple tasks such as counting words or reversing a list models often lack awareness of their limitations11 and more worryingly express overconfidence in their abilities it is difficult to understand how generative ai generates its outputs whether truthful or not generative ai lacks knowledge recency beyond its training data so it may struggle with tasks that require updated information one obvious solution is to update the data and retrain the model but that gives rise to another chal- lenge catastrophic forgetting since ai does not retain memory when it is trained on new data or for a new task that creates challenges there are many efforts to address these limitations and there has been tremendous progress since early itera- tions of generative ai some involve enabling large language models to invoke other tools to improve their outputs such as a calculator for arithmetic tasks or a web search engine to access more recent information beyond their train- ing data other approaches imply editing the models through different mechanisms but it might not be possible to eliminate limitations entirely particularly given current algorithmic architectures and approaches because these models have no representation of ground truths against which they can assess the veracity of outputs at the time of writing the hallucination rate of the most advanced large language model released by openai gpt- was per- cent down from the percent of its predecessor gpt- o great progress but far from eliminating hallucinations notes banh and strobel focus on generative ai some challenges relate more broadly to machine learning which often reflects shortcut learning where the model identifies spurious correlations in the data that allow it to perform well on some benchmarks without understanding why it does so geirhos and others minaee and others santu and feng cao and others polverini and gregorcic white and others beurer-k ellner fischer and vechev suggest that prompting is programming for a

and affordances of artificial intelligence recent artificial intelligence ai developments have generated much interest about safety both in the potential for misuse of ai and in the accidental risks that may emerge as unintended consequences some evidence suggests that even when designed to mitigate these risks sometimes referred to as aligning ai with human values large language models are capable of mimicking or faking this alignment covertly pursuing misaligned goals posing security and privacy risks4 and disclosing sensitive private or illegal information at the same time human limitations such as difficulty distinguishing between human- and ai- generated text along with the expansion of content generated by ai pose new risks of misuse7 or accidents ai has been around for a long time so where does the renewed interest in safety come from in part from the new affordances of ai and four notable features first ai can exhibit abilities in areas outside those intended or considered in its design unlike classical program- ming where machines excelled at the task they were programmed to perform large language models trained to pre- dict the next word in a text sequence have proved helpful in tasks ranging from translation to writing computer code second ai can be generative producing novel output based on descriptive prompts expressed in everyday lan- guage unlike classical computer machines that execute instructions only from prespecified scripts in early it was reported that chatgpt alone was generating billion words a day within one year this would be roughly equivalent to the amount of high- quality text available on the internet third ai can personalize and customize outputs adaptively and iteratively and do it quickly and at scale unlike classical programming s outputs in the form of one size fits all with limited opportunities for rapid and dynamic customization at scale applications for personalization hold particular promise in education and healthcare fourth ai is very efficient at discerning useful patterns in data that are hard for people to do while classical program- ming can provide insights only from data guided by human intuition one practical application of this feature of ai is the rapid progress in predicting protein folding in biology something that used to take humans much time and effort as such the same features that motivate concern for ai safety underlie much of its potential for augmentation excising these features is thus a simple but limiting solution requiring alternatives that guide ai

manufacture themselves that of a human being however what this means precisely remains undefined and on close inspection this special organismic power is called basic agency undefinable and there is nothing mysterious about it it is entirely compatible with what we know about thermodynamics and the physics of living systems agency arises from algorithms cannot frame problems the peculiar organization of material and energetic flows in a living organism that enable it to manufacture intelligence counter to widespread intuition relies itself biologists call this autopoiesis

we will acquire the capability to pass judgement on what a relevant problem is in to build any truly autopoietic artefacts anytime soon the first place evidently the two are not the same the basic idea behind self-manufacture is a little this is why artificial intelligence is such a terrible counterintuitive but not extremely difficult to grasp misnomer algorithms cannot frame problems they the counterintuitive part is that the organization of always operate within a fixed frame the problems an organism folds in on itself like a snake that bites they solve must be defined for them however

which artificial intelligence ai can exceed the performance of even talented individuals is rapidly increasing resulting in speculation that ai will soon do so at all tasks humans complete this in turn leads to hope and concerns about a forthcoming artificial general intelligence singularity wherein ai surpasses and obviates the need for human intelligence a key stated goal of several large ai firms yet even if a given ai can beat any human at any task exceeding and replacing human intelligence will remain far beyond the horizon although this may seem counterintuitive the distance arises from the fact that collective human intelligence far exceeds what individuals can accomplish alone in one famous early 20th century example individual fairgoers estimates of the weight of an ox varied widely and tended to be quite poor yet the average estimate was within percent of the true value in more applied contexts small groups of radiologists can do far better than even the best individual radiologist ai performance at this task and others will often fall far short of what humans accomplish collectively and while it may seem that the solution is simply to create collective artificial general intelligence science in the intervening century has revealed why this is unlikely to work collective intelligence manifests not from large numbers but from complex interactions between the structure of our social networks our diverse agency and capabilities our active capacity to inhabit probe and sense the physical world and the cumulative accumulation of culture over millennia even ostensible human limitations such as our finite capacity for maintaining social relationships appear to be features not bugs of collective intelligence by analogy to ai collective intelligence arises through an evo- lutionarily adapted network of every human that has ever lived each possessing a unique and constantly updating training set prompts and alignment a single model that exceeds humans on individual tasks even all of them is still no match for collective intelligence the question then becomes when and how ai can augment human intelligence more broadly for the reasons outlined in this chapter replacing humans even with very advanced ai is unlikely to be ideal for promoting collective intelligence no ai on the horizon will possess humans capacity to diversely curiously continuously and actively explore the physical world and share the information gleaned with others through finely tuned social networks that produce emergent human intelligence rather than awaiting such an ai we

artificial intelligence revolutionizing biomedicine generative artificial intelligence ai has the potential to generate much more than text images and video and there is substantial interest in applying ai to biomedical research and development two active intertwined areas of research surround protein folding and drug discovery proteins are large molecules synthesized within cells from amino acids that serve various functions and are common targets of medicines intended to treat disease discerning their three-dimensional shape is essential for understanding their function and developing drugs that target specific proteins more recently mrna vaccines have made it possible to encourage cells to generate proteins not found in their genetic code with promising applications for allergies infectious diseases cancer and genetic disorders unfortunately computing the structure of a given protein has historically been computationally intensive requiring access to larger servers or distributed computing efforts such as recent advances in ai such as alphafold3 can predict the structure of proteins at drastically reduced computational cost with increasingly high accuracy challenges of protein folding are intrinsically linked to ai-powered drug discovery which seeks to identify compounds that often interact with proteins such as receptors or enzymes to produce some desired biological effect ideally the compounds already exist and are approved for treating other conditions ai applications for drug development are on the rise because they can rapidly propose and assess candidate drugs potentially speeding discovery and aiding in identifying promising candidates ai can be further used to de- velop pathways for drug synthesis or to speed up testing of proposed drugs investment in ai-fuelled drug discovery is ramping up with the first ai-discovered drugs hitting the market in although the use of ai in medicine is nascent there is little doubt that it has big potential to advance the field in the coming years key challenges remain in making these technologies more widely accessible so that research and development can be expanded beyond a finite set of for-profit institutions and well-funded universities one such effort colabfold was developed in this free and accessible protein folding platform provides better functionality than google s

recommendations in digital platforms and human development artificial intelligence as part of the problem part of the solution artificial intelligence ai is not the issue with recommender systems since any solution to improving online recommendations will likely require some form of ai a core problem with current approaches is that they derive recommendations primarily from human behaviour often simply to keep us engaged on the platform people s choices provide important information about what matters to them but as amartya sen forcefully argued their choices cannot provide a full account of their motivations perhaps the most salient reason for this gap is that choice does not necessarily reflect a maximization of preferences and can be driven by other motives for example choosing to engage with misleading information online reflects a constraint in the quality of information available rather than a preference for false information so recommender systems based on behaviour do not provide an opportunity for people to ground recommendations on a broader set of aspects of what matters to them this is key for human development since it relates to the extent that people can exercise their agency and ultimately their freedom from a human development perspective this is a fundamental concern perhaps less visible than other problems with behaviour- based recommendations which include both the exploitation of what psychologist daniel kahneman called system- thinking behavioural biases that digital platforms exploit for engagement and the difficulty of accounting for heterogeneity in preferences recommender systems could be giving poor recommendations but more importantly they are shaping the choice architecture online and perhaps impoverishing the concept of what it means to be human if what people do online is assumed to represent what people want to see recommender systems are thus biased to make people more passive recipients of online content rather than active agents able to access what matters to them potentially undermining people as moral agents through moral deskilling moreover recommender systems optimized for engagement particularly in social media seek to maximize the attention users devote to the platforms and to give content producers more opportunities to have their creations seen of course this is driven also by the revenue-g eneration model of the platforms which is determined primarily through engagement by both content consumers and producers with higher engagement providing more opportunity to sell advertising that can be targeted there is an active debate on how to develop recommender systems optimized for things other than engagement given some of the individual and collective harms associated with these systems but whether recommender systems could be optimized for some- thing else relates also to the possibility of going beyond relying on online behaviour as the basis for recommendation so that in addition to what people do online recommendations could match who they are and what they value and have reason to value one possibility is to use some sort of middleware that mediates between the digital platform and the users but this would still not enable recommendations to reflect users preferences and beliefs another possible approach would be to use large language models given their ability to call on other tools say a search engine or a calculator to execute tasks that go beyond their immediate training or that are required by the user prompt when recommender systems were first developed algo- rithms could not engage in regular spoken language and could not explicitly reason the same way current models can the flexibility and adaptability of large language models provide options to explore how they can be used as agents if progress is made in addressing some of the inherent limitations of the technology including privacy security and trust concerns a generative ai recommender agent could learn about what matters to the user by engaging conversationally for example by asking about what he or she values and has reason to value19 and iteratively compile content that aligns with those values and preferences rather than taking human agency away from the interaction with digital platforms these recommender agents could scaffold human agency in the interaction with online content notes li and others provide a survey of recent developments see also shen and others sen sen for a summary of sen s view on preferences and choice see for instance anderson for a recent critique that extends to the broader challenge of framing ai alignment as being driven by the rational maximization of preferences see zhi- xuan and others stewart and others sen agarwal and others besbes kanoria and kumar kleinberg mullainathan and raghavan kleinberg and others d chen and others yao and others rita gonçalves and others agan and others as noted above there are also privacy concerns with technical options being pursued to address these but without fundamentally changing the behaviour-b ased engine of the recommendation chronis and others schuster and lazar a different challenge relates to moderation which deals with the choices that platforms make on what content to allow in order to comply with the law and each platform s terms of service as well as how to achieve those goals outsourcing fact checking using algorithms to detect prohibited content or having users flag noncompliant content on moderation in digital platforms see douek gorwa binns and katzenbach and lai and others on tensions between free speech and moderation and ways of addressing them see kozyreva and others moderation and recommender systems optimized for engagement might not be independent because content that elicits more engage- ment is often extreme and close to the bounds of what is accepted so there might be an inherent tradeoff between effective moderation and

system align with acceptable technical performance as well as social cultural and ethical norms and values audits can be a critical tool for ensuring that these powerful systems are aligned with the principles of human development promoting individual freedoms expanding choices and enhancing the dignity and worth of all people by rigorously evaluating the development deployment manage- ment and operations of ai systems audits can help uncover whether a system engenders individual and collective harms that could undermine core human development objectives they can help ensure that technical

but empirical findings remain inconclu- sive the magnitude timing and distribution of productivity effects are uncertain and depend heavily on the methodol- ogy and assumptions the us national academies of sciences engineering and medicine has proposed a framework for assessing ai s productivity effects by identifying key factors that may shape its impact the factors provide a helpful overview of the conditions that influence ai adoption the channels through which ai can affect productivity and the potential barriers to realizing its full economic impact they include share of the economy in which the technology can be applied and size of the productivity effect in those applica- tions this follows from hulten s theorem which shows that in well-functioning economies an increase in total factor productivity in one industry will change the overall output in an economy in proportion to the industry s share of total sales ai is seen as a general purpose technology it has economywide applicability beyond specific industries the productivity effects in particular industries by contrast depend on whether ai primarily replaces humans or augments what humans are doing complements and bottlenecks deploying a new technology without considering parallel investment would likely yield disappointing results workers need complementary skills and firms and organizations may need to adjust workflows to fully leverage ai digital infrastructure is critical and targeted investment may be needed in many regions furthermore governance frameworks might require time to adjust to new technologies informal institu- tions such as those for social cohesion and trust can also act as complements or bottlenecks to realizing the technology s potential time lags and measurement both benefits and costs from technological innovation may be hard to quantify especially for a general purpose technology some ai-driven benefits such as enhanced learning through per-

spillovers both the benefits and costs of technological innovation can spill over from the private in- novator to other parts of society ai with its many use cases may have large impacts through these spillovers for example improving medical diagnosis13 can have positive spillovers to public health while negative spillovers such as rent seeking or widespread ai-generated misinformation could distort markets and limit ai s economic potential heterogeneity within and across businesses and sectors the extent to which ai enhances productivity in a sector or for a firm is contingent on

gains firms able to adapt organizational structures and workflows to ai and leverage ai for product innovation may see higher growth15 than those slower to adapt disparities within firms may arise between workers who are able to leverage ai to augment their work and workers who struggle to integrate it into their work or see large parts of their tasks displaced dynamic effects beyond spillovers
