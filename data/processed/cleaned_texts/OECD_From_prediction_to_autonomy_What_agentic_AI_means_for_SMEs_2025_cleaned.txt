digital for smes d4sme knowledge event september virtual webinar from prediction to autonomy what agentic ai means for smes what s the issue ai is ushering in a new era of autonomy and decision-making in digital systems and the implications for small and medium-sized enterprises smes could be profound ai adoption among smes is growing rapidly since the release of generative ai services to the public in from to for small businesses and from to for medium-sized businesses between and the overall share still lags significantly behind large firms of which now report using ai up from in as the pace of innovation accelerates ensuring that smes are not left behind is more urgent than ever ai agents are autonomous systems capable of setting goals making decisions and executing tasks with a high degree of autonomy from humans applications range from software development and customer support to cybersecurity and business intelligence for smes still gaining ground with ai tools the emergence of agentic ai marks an evolution that brings fresh opportunities and challenges from ai-driven customer service agents to autonomous supply chain managers these systems promise to unlock productivity gains previously out of reach for resource-constrained firms but they also raise new questions about accountability risk data governance and the readiness of firms and markets to adopt them responsibly key highlights sme adoption of ai is accelerating the democratisation the technology but gaps with large firms persist by lowering requirements for capital and technical expertise generative ai can provide smes with access to tools once reserved for large corporations this could level the playing field by reducing administrative burdens opening access to inclusive financial services and supporting competitiveness in global markets agentic ai - systems with autonomy memory and adaptability - is a paradigm shift this evolution of ai technology is moving beyond reactive tools to proactive collaborators it could help smes automate tasks personalise services and expand innovation while raising new challenges of governance accountability and readiness barriers to adoption remain significant smes face resource constraints integration challenges fast-changing technology cycles and difficulties in building internal and external trust concerns around bias liability data security and workforce preparedness were raised as critical obstacles that need to be addressed policy and governance priorities should centre on enabling responsible adoption speakers called for investment in digital and financial literacy trism frameworks trust risk and security management and interoperability standards to avoid vendor lock-in proportionate regulation and regulatory sandboxes were highlighted as essential to balance innovation with oversight making compliance the easy choice for smes sme ecosystem collaboration is critical associations hubs and partnerships can act as multipliers helping smes test solutions share use cases and build confidence peer learning and cooperation with larger firms academia and civil society can provide smes with adoption pathways international alignment is crucial initiatives at the oecd un and industry fora were seen as vital to develop common standards foster trust and enable smes to adopt agentic ai

director oecd centre for entrepreneurship smes regions and cities cfe nadim ahmad opened the webinar by welcoming speakers and attendees with special thanks to deputy minister valentino valentini of italy chair of the initiative and to partners of the d4sme initiative including amazon intuit kakao microsoft paypal sage and wolt he highlighted recent achievements of the initiative the d4sme survey on sme digitalisation for competitiveness the 6th digital for sme d4sme roundtable which gathered in paris participants from countries and the launch of the smes in the digital economy stakeholder pledge on the impulse of deputy minister valentini he noted that ai adoption among smes is accelerating across the oecd with adoption by small businesses almost doubling between and from to and from to in medium sized businesses though a gap with large firms remains at the frontier agentic ai could help smes automate processes personalise services and scale innovation but it also raises questions of accountability governance and readiness deputy minister valentino valentini ministry of enterprises and made in italy d4sme chair deputy minister valentino valentini framed agentic ai as the most transformative shift since the internet revolution stressing that smes face a choice between fear and opportunity he recalled the smes in the digital economy stakeholder pledge to leave no sme behind in the digital transition and underlined that agentic ai is not just another tool but a paradigm shift from reactive systems to proactive collaborators sme uptake of ai continues to trail that of larger enterprises and the deputy minister noted that without targeted support this gap may persist at the same time he underlined ai s potential to broaden access to advanced technologies enabling smaller firms to benefit from tools that were once available only to large corporations and thereby contributing to a more level playing field to seize these opportunities he called for investment in digital literacy the establishment of trism frameworks trust risk and security management interoperability standards to avoid vendor lock-in and balanced regulation citing the eu ai act as both necessary and enabling he concluded by urging smes to act as architects of the future rather than passive observers stressing that the choice is to embrace transformation with courage and collaboration or risk being left behind professor angela aristidou professor of strategy and entrepreneurship university college london school of management professor angela aristidou provided a keynote address setting the scene for the panel discussions she explained the evolution from traditional ai to generative ai and now to agentic ai which she described as systems with autonomy memory adaptability and integration capabilities unlike static tools agentic ai can take initiative learn from experience and connect with external data and applications to complete tasks she underlined that the main challenge is not technological progress but imagination and trust drawing parallels with the slow diffusion of electricity she noted that smes will need time to reconfigure processes and business models to capture the benefits of agentic ai for smaller firms the technology may reduce barriers by lowering requirements for capital compute and technical expertise potentially allowing them to leapfrog directly to agentic ai solutions yet issues of integration workforce skills and trust in autonomous decision-making remain central aristidou concluded that agentic ai holds great promise to expand sme capabilities from rapid experimentation to new forms of business intelligence but that success will depend on building sme-friendly tools interoperability and collaborative ecosystems that support responsible adoption panel reinventing smes with agentic ai panel examined how agentic ai systems - tools capable of autonomous goal setting decision-making and task execution - could reshape the operational and financial models of smes panellists explored how agentic ai can help smes overcome resource constraints while also highlighting risks of dependency governance gaps and uneven adoption levelling the playing field panellists stressed that agentic ai has the potential to democratise advanced technologies by automating complex processes such as supply-chain management pricing and customer discovery ai agents could offer smes capabilities once reserved for large corporations this as michelle gill noted would free small business owners from administrative burdens and allow them to focus on growth while also opening opportunities to reach global markets she warned however that smes must not be disintermediated in ai-mediated marketplaces where discoverability depends on clear product and service descriptions rather than search rankings josefina movillo matta stressed that in chile where smes represent of firms and of jobs agentic ai could be a tool to make financial services more inclusive and expand innovation beyond early adopters she also pointed to emerging pilots where smes use ai as virtual cfos to monitor cash flow negotiate with suppliers and access credit lowering barriers to adoption a recurring theme was that agentic ai may lower some of the traditional barriers smes face in digital transformation benjamin chino highlighted that unlike earlier forms of ai agentic ai can be accessible even to firms without large budgets or technical teams at maki people recruitment agents can be deployed in days without specialist expertise allowing smes to experiment quickly and scale solutions once value is demonstrated he argued that smes flexibility may allow them to adopt and scale ai faster than larger firms josefina movillo matta added that peer-to-peer learning networking and collaboration are particularly powerful in lowering entry barriers helping firms learn from practical examples rather than navigating adoption alone challenges and risks despite this promise several challenges were identified all speakers emphasised that smes face a multi- layered trust challenge first building confidence within their own teams then earning the trust of customers and finally demonstrating compliance to regulators this challenge is particularly acute in sensitive areas such as hiring and financial services where concerns over bias transparency and liability are especially high as benjamin chino highlighted these pressures are compounded by limited resources and the rapid pace of technological change which make it difficult for smes to keep up michelle gill further added that fast- changing compliance requirements impose heavy burdens on smes citing oecd d4sme survey evidence showing that many smes remain uncertain about how to use ai and are concerned about privacy and liability josefina movillo matta finally emphasised that for many firms the challenge is less technological than human developing the talent digital capabilities and the data infrastructure to use new tools effectively policy and governance priorities panellists converged on key priorities for enabling responsible adoption regulatory simplicity and proportionality michelle gill urged governments to clarify that existing o consumer protection laws apply to ai-enabled commerce rather than layering new complexity josefina movillo matta called for proportionate regulation that balances innovation with safeguards capacity building josefina movillo matta emphasised investment in digital and financial literacy o talent development and cybersecurity supported through public-private collaboration to appropriately identify needs and combine resources evaluation and standards benjamin chino stressed the importance of evaluation frameworks and o trusted partners in sensitive domains such as recruitment and josefina movillo matta added that interoperability standards are essential to avoid vendor lock-in ecosystem support and adoption pathways michelle gill called for governments to establish o innovation hubs and economic incentives that combine public and private resources ensuring smes can access ai-powered discovery and commerce benjamin chino added that smes themselves should adopt agentic ai step by step starting small proving value and then scaling supported by policies that make experimentation possible conclusion taken together the panel underscored that agentic ai could be a powerful enabler for smes - but only if adoption is accompanied by the right mix of skills standards and collaborative frameworks to ensure trust fairness and inclusion panel shaping agentic ai adoption by smes panel examined how stakeholders including governments technology providers and industry associations can cooperate to support smes in adopting agentic ai and how to balance innovation with responsible regulation the discussion highlighted the need for cross-sector collaboration adaptive governance and clear safeguards to ensure that smes can benefit from ai without being overwhelmed by risks or compliance burdens building the conditions for adoption panellists agreed that creating the right conditions for adoption requires both public investment and private- sector leadership almudena martín castro explained that spain s strategic projects unit acts as a connector across ministries industries and associations to identify where ai adoption could generate the greatest societal and economic impact while also considering trade-offs such as labour market disruption environmental costs and europe s technological sovereignty spain s kit digital and red es programmes were highlighted as examples of financial support that lower upfront costs and provide advisory services enabling smes to experiment with digital tools panellists also highlighted the crucial role of industry associations in supporting ai adoption and diffusion among smes usman ikhlaq added that industry associations and hubs act as critical enablers creating shared spaces for smes to exchange knowledge overcome legacy barriers and build the confidence needed to experiment with new ai tools responsible innovation and safeguards speakers emphasised that adoption must be accompanied by safeguards hector de rivoire argued that the true test of ai s value lies not in frontier models but in their integration into everyday business particularly for smes advances in reasoning and multimodal training have enabled more agentic behaviours such as sequencing tasks and calling external tools but these dual-use features carry risks the same system that patches vulnerabilities could also generate malware to mitigate such risks microsoft has embedded governance into product development including a sensitive use case team systematic red-teaming and post-deployment monitoring almudena martín castro added that large technology providers have a key role in scaling safe shared solutions while usman ikhlaq underlined that smes need trusted frameworks to assess and mitigate risk without excessive compliance costs ecosystem cooperation and sme readiness panellists stressed that effective adoption depends on cooperation across the wider ecosystem and on strengthening sme capabilities usman ikhlaq noted that techuk s sme membership illustrates both the opportunities and barriers in practice emphasising the need to build ai literacy basic understanding of what ai is and ai fluency the skills to apply and supervise it responsibly he further stressed the importance of developing soft skills such oversight explainability and knowing when to intervene for smes he concurred benjamin chino that the most effective approach is to think big but start small testing use cases aligned with business goals and scaling gradually almudena martín castro highlighted the role of indesia an industrial data and ai association where large firms co-develop use cases that are then shared with smes as an example of how associations can diffuse innovation and foster cultural change finally hector de rivoire added that collaboration across industry academia policymakers and civil society is essential to building a credible science of ai safety and evaluation through shared methodologies and evaluation practices policy and governance priorities all panellists agreed that adaptive governance frameworks are needed to balance innovation with oversight almudena martín castro identified adaptive instruments such as regulatory sandboxes as vital for balancing innovation and oversight allowing regulators to learn alongside firms she also called for simpler more streamlined regulation that makes compliance the easy choice for smes hector de rivoire highlighted transparency as the backbone of governance citing the g7 hiroshima ai process reporting framework supported by the oecd as a strong foundation for structured disclosure across the ecosystem he also called for regulation to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each actor across the ai ecosystem ensuring shared accountability usman ikhlaq added that legal certainty proportionate liability and clarity on penalties are prerequisites for sme confidence particularly in regulated sectors such as finance or health conclusion in closing the panellists converged on the importance of international alignment initiatives at the un oecd and through industry-led frameworks were seen as essential to ensure that agentic ai diffuses across borders in a way that fosters trust protects rights and enables smes to compete on a more level playing field concluding remarks marco bianchini coordinator of the d4sme global initiative thanked speakers and participants for their contribution to the discussion he highlighted the broad consensus among experts from government academia and both small and large businesses that generative ai and in particular agentic ai could represent a profound shift in how smes operate and collaborate he emphasised the need for governments across the oecd and beyond to closely monitor the evolution in the diffusion of the technology and be prepared to design and implement policies aimed at ensuring its safe and responsible adoption he concluded the webinar by inviting all participants to the next d4sme knowledge event scheduled for december the speakers mr valentino
