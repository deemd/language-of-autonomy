decade it s clear that ai is the defining disrupter of our time ai s reach is broader than any recent tech wave reshaping business strategy politics trade defense and even social justice two years ago we warned that it was already too late to wait and see by then leaders were using ai to improve ebitda by to while laggards fell further behind today those leaders are compounding their gains and embracing agentic ai if you re still piloting you re dangerously behind bain s sixth technology report delivers insights on this and other tech trends through the pragmatic lens of the real work we do with clients the advance of ai agents is the immediate top line story at full potential they ll run complete processes and workflows our report explores the implications for software strategy enterprise deployment humanoid robotics and it architecture while also looking at broader implications for tech company valuation trade relations power production and talent management david crawford chairman of bain s global technology media and telecommunications practice value evolution will ai disrupt tech s most valuable companies sovereign tech fragmented world deals rise in but easy wins may be over value evolution will ai disrupt tech s most valuable companies hyperscalers and other market leaders have adapted well to technology shifts but generative ai poses new challenges by david crawford matthew crupi and adam haller at a glance today s tech giants have proven unusually resistant co opting disruption through self reinvention ai could change that as it introduces more layers of competition across infrastructure models applications devices search and browsers incumbents are doubling down investing heavily in ai to stay ahead while fast moving challengers gain traction and funding geopolitics regulation quantum and agentic ai add uncertainty making adaptability critical at every turn in bain s technology report we noted the remarkable resilience of today s most valuable technology companies and their ability to co opt disruption see the chapter how tech leaders commercialize technology report innovation several tech giants with the largest market caps have maintained their lead for years or more that s a big change from earlier eras when disruptive innovation regularly vaulted new companies to the top spots while moving old ones aside the difference appears to be that today s leaders are better at adapting to technology shifts due to their ability to self disrupt and reinvent their businesses will ai change that ai generative and agentic with its ability to transform work processes and the unprecedented speed of its adoption is this decade s disruption in tech and beyond looking at today s top tech companies gives us insight into whether we expect the existing leaders to remain at the top or if we may see significant shifts at first glance today s value creation pattern mirrors what we saw during the shift to cloud computing lots of value created by the incumbents amazon microsoft alphabet meta nvidia and a few others but also a set of vibrant entrants creating winning models tools and applications see figure but ai s innovations range further and wider than those of the cloud aggressive challengers are gaining attention and funding that could put them in direct competition with today s most valuable companies while the leaders that emerged in the cloud era played mostly at the application layer the ai era will see fierce competition at many levels including infrastructure models and devices figure market value remains concentrated in the tech incumbents but new players are entering the top notes private company valuations based on latest round of funding public company valuations based on market capitalization on september sources s p capital iq crunchbase technology report early winners in the ai era the most valuable tech companies have emerged as early winners in the ai era further concentrating value at the top the five biggest companies account for more than of the total market value of the top up from last year nvidia s market cap is up more than since january and microsoft amazon alphabet apple and meta are all valued above trillion the hyperscalers are investing heavily in ai infrastructure talent models and applications to protect their positions see figure at the same time a new set of winners is emerging privately owned openai is valued at around billion which would place it among the top companies if it were public anthropic is valued at more than billion other ai companies including glean anysphere mistral and figure also have huge valuations ranging from billion to nearly billion according to cb insights there were about times more tech unicorns start ups valued at more than billion added in compared with more layers of competition tech leaders can monetize their investments in a range of ways because they re competing at every level owning the infrastructure building their own models for example google s gemini or amazon s nova defining platforms and capturing disproportionate value at the application layer figure hyperscalers are increasing capital investment in ai at the infrastructure platform and application levels notes company data based on fiscal years ending december for amazon alphabet and meta june for microsoft forecast values are from earnings calls source company capex data from s p capital iq and earnings calls technology report but in the age of ai that dynamic may be shifting because new players are encroaching on the leaders at every layer of the ai stack infrastructure start ups like coreweave offer specialized high performance gpu as a service infrastructure optimized for ai and gpu intensive workloads often at lower latency and cost than the traditional cloud computing services hardware incumbents such as nvidia are building ai factories specialized high performance data centers built for the demands of the ai era to strengthen their position and governments are pushing for sovereign ai capabilities by investing in domestic infrastructure models new players such as openai anthropic and mistral have quickly gained ground in many cases with early investment from the hyperscalers themselves these start ups are proving that foundation model innovation isn t limited to big tech applications will still be where we expect to see the most new value and potential disrupters for example anysphere which was founded in and is currently valued at billion has rapidly gained traction among developers with its ai powered code editor cursor reinforcing how being best in class can still win against the large tech firms products in addition to these layers insurgents are competing with tech leaders in new areas devices ai phones could shake up the established smartphone landscape consider the potential impact of a gemini enabled android phone or a device resulting from the collaboration of openai and jony ive search chatbots like chatgpt claude or perplexity ai are already starting to displace search as the entry point to the internet browsers ai based browsers like the ones developed by perplexity and openai could reignite the browser wars of the     s each of these control points provides the incumbents with a wealth of data to improve their offerings and they may need to self disrupt as ai changes the playing field but they ll need to move rapidly to compete the newcomers are more agile and cost efficient allowing them to move quickly mistral for example which is valued at more than billion and has fewer than employees can innovate and iterate quickly with its light hierarchy uncertainties shaping the ai market beyond direct competition multiple dynamics are unfolding adding significant uncertainty to the environment technology report agentic ai these systems can perform complex workflows make decisions without human prompts and adapt dynamically which could disrupt traditional software paradigms legacy players in the application layer for example enterprise saas may find their models disrupted by competitors embedding agentic ai that delivers end to end outcomes for more read will agentic ai disrupt saas us china relations geopolitical tensions are fracturing global technology supply chains particularly in semiconductors and ai hardware export controls investment restrictions and sanctions are leading tech companies to reconfigure global strategies and confront uncertain access to key markets as china s firms accelerate domestic alternatives and us firms shift manufacturing the resulting decoupling could reshuffle global tech leadership with regional champions replacing global incumbents regulatory pressure governments are ramping up scrutiny on data privacy violations and ai safety at major tech firms many are pushing for their own sovereign ai to limit dependency on the us  based leaders with some hoping to develop their own national champions quantum computing quantum represents a foundational shift in computation threatening to make classical encryption obsolete and redefine problem solving in materials science logistics and ai as governments and companies race to develop quantum advantage the first movers could leapfrog current tech giants in sectors from cloud to cybersecurity the uncertainty around when scalable quantum breakthroughs will occur leaves incumbents exposed to disruption from start ups or state  backed programs with early breakthroughs what does this mean for technology leaders incumbent tech leaders keep doing what you have been doing disrupt innovate attract talent and acquire and partner for new capabilities there is more competition at every layer models devices browsers gpu as a service and there are also more opportunities to scale legacy technology embrace and extend act quickly start by cutting costs monitor the horizon and be willing to disrupt your business invest in innovation while enhancing capabilities through acquisitions and partnerships understand your customers needs and make the most of those valuable relationships disrupters and start ups understand the scale of investment required to compete with the hyperscalers talent is scarce so develop a strategy to acquire and retain the right people identify new ways to better serve your customers needs disruption brings opportunity to reshape the basis of competition the technology industry has been riding this wave of disruption since openai released its first chatbot other industries have been slower to adopt but ai s disruption is likely to extend well beyond tech companies across sectors early movers will have an advantage value evolution sovereign tech fragmented world in a post globalized era of tariffs and decoupling semiconductors and sovereign ai are realigning global power by anne hoecker karen harris jonathan frick and ravi vijayaraghavan at a glance tariffs export controls and governments sovereign ai push are accelerating the fragmentation of global tech supply chains and centers of influence china and the us continue to compete across the full tech stack from software to hardware sovereign ai definitions and strategies vary by country but the commonality is investment to avoid being left behind leading companies will make decisions with optionality moving boldly where confidence is high and prioritizing flexibility where uncertainty rules as geopolitical fragmentation accelerates in this post globalization era technology sits squarely at the fault line key cutting edge domains semiconductors ai communications quantum computing and biotechnology are no longer just catalysts for innovation and economic growth but conduits for countries political power national security and strategic advantage governments are stepping in technology report more forcefully actively influencing and directing the flow of capital talent and intellectual property technological self reliance to the extent it s possible is becoming a more urgent priority for nations worldwide partly as a means of protecting themselves in case tech leading countries wield their control over essential technologies cloud computing mission critical business software defense as a geopolitical cudgel for several years these dynamics have created constant unpredictable challenges for technology executives two issues are rising fast on boardroom agendas the near term effects of tariffs on technology supply chains and the longer term business implications of governments accelerating push for sovereign ai two issues are rising fast on boardroom agendas the near term effects of tariffs on technology supply chains and the longer term business implications of governments accelerating push for sovereign ai navigating this more complex and fundamentally different tech environment will require updated strategies new bets and a high tolerance for ambiguity the decoupling core semiconductors and the electronics supply chain semiconductors are the pressure point at the epicenter of today s geopolitical tensions aiming to protect its advantage in leading edge compute and the technologies it powers the us has steadily tightened export controls on advanced chips chipmaking tools electronic design automation software and high  bandwidth memory chips destined for china the restrictions and tariffs implemented by the us on china beginning in sparked a wave of supply chain diversification many companies adopted a china plus one strategy that shifted manufacturing to countries such as mexico and vietnam now the second trump administration has proposed more extensive tariffs on a much wider set of countries for many tech executives this raises significant supply chain questions given the complex global nature of the electronics value chain no longer can the answer simply be china plus one a broader set of options must now be considered to ensure supply and cost stability the only real hedge against unpredictable shocks to the system is continued regionalization or even nationalization supply chains will become even more dispersed technology report china for its part is racing toward self reliance since it has invested more than billion in semiconductor manufacturing tripling its domestic production capacity to a projected nearly million wafers per month this year that s roughly of global capacity while most of this growth is in mature lagging edge semiconductor nodes china is also making progress in the production of more advanced chips smaller than nanometers now accounting for around one fifth of global output of logic chips and a quarter of memory chips see figure china s strides are challenging the notion that market leadership in semiconductors is solely defined by the leading edge while still critical memories of the semiconductor shortage in and remind executives that a lack of lagging edge chips can keep a company from shipping final products china s strong position in less advanced chips which have a larger global supplier base initially led many to assume that customers would eagerly switch to vendors outside of china but overcapacity in mature nodes and the perceived flexibility to change suppliers later have kept the status quo intact longer than expected it s yet another signal that decoupling isn t linear and it s far from over sovereign ai leveling the playing field the concept of sovereign ai has rapidly evolved from theory to geopolitical imperative sovereign ai systems are trained on domestic or culturally appropriate data hosted by nationally or regionally controlled data centers if possible and increasingly rely on open source foundation models developed figure china now accounts for a large chunk of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity note fab capacity measured by wafer starts per month sources gartner bank of america semi bain analysis technology report domestically which allows governments and institutions to audit the systems for bias transparency and misuse this isn t just about privacy or control it s about data security and aligning ai outputs with national values regulatory standards and strategic priorities all while reducing dependence on foreign tech ecosystems sovereign ai capabilities are increasingly seen as a strategic advantage on par with economic and military strength the race between the chinese and american tech ecosystems is at the forefront of the decoupling movement both countries are advancing swiftly the us leads in high performance chips and foundation models while china is expanding its ai capabilities through initiatives including the deepseek r  model and huawei s ascend    c chip all developed with minimal us tech china is also investing heavily in physical ai such as humanoid robotics meanwhile south korea dominates in high bandwidth memory chips illustrating the complexity of the global ecosystem and the fact that it remains difficult for any one country to become completely self reliant see figure while hardware models and apps are decoupling open source technologies and talent continue to cross pollinate however sovereign ai is a global priority the eu s billion investai initiative launched in february includes billion to build ai gigafactories data centers equipped with at least graphics figure chinese companies offer options in many of the critical ai tech components notes market share based on revenue except for the ai models category which is based on the number of large scale models released

participation in the global ecosystem practicality trumps purity for most countries it s simply not feasible to achieve full stack independence at least not today given the realities of where semiconductor fabs are clustered and which countries control the best ai models that divergence will complicate everything for tech companies as ai becomes embedded in business operations from customer engagement to supply chain management multinational firms will need to localize not just compliance but technology architecture a single ai workflow may need to be retooled for different markets with varying models training data data usage practices and infrastructure requirements and global ai standards unlikely from content censorship to data labeling to acceptable uses definitions of responsible ai differ widely and likely won t converge ai systems are becoming more like national or regional products shaped by the political and cultural norms in which they re developed strategic implications rethinking how and where to compete executives are starting to recognize this isn t a passing phase it s a new world order with profound consequences for everything a business does to steer their organizations effectively through this new era leading tech companies are focusing on four key principles to steer their organizations effectively through this new era leading tech companies are focusing on four key principles think in operating models not just product lines some countries will build their own ai capacity or treat it as a strategic lever others will simply buy from the cheapest available source that creates a patchwork of environments in which companies must tailor how they build deploy and monetize technology will local laws demand new infrastructure retrained models or local data partnerships if so what trade offs are acceptable don t assume the global tech race is over it s very much still on and has a long way to go as tariffs and export controls haven t slowed china as much as expected the journey will be volatile and bumpy with technology report big unknowns surrounding possible trade deals and the knock on effects of china s accelerated investments in technology manufacturing capacity leading companies will closely follow developments particularly in generative ai and humanoid robotics don t mistake relocation for resilience for multinational technology companies moving production out of china is a start but it s no longer enough supply chains must be regionalized flexible and built for continued political volatility establishing a stronger presence in the most important end markets is becoming more crucial particularly for semiconductors and other strategic capital intensive sectors make decisions with optionality executives won t get every bet right where confidence is high move boldly where the future is murky prioritize flexibility for some companies that might mean setting up neutral region tech hubs will dubai become the next singapore for others it may mean delaying or skipping certain markets altogether because they re too costly or complex to serve value evolution deals rise in but easy wins may be over riding growth used to be easy in software now investors have to go out and find it efficiently by david lipman christopher perry jennifer smith and jonny holliday at a glance despite a difficult market technology deals increased their share of all buyouts in the first half of yet evidence continues to mount that the days of easy wins in software are receding into the rearview mirror investors generating top tier results in the year ahead will be those working harder to find new sources of growth and those executing on those opportunities more efficiently after a fast start to extending a strong finish in technology deal making has not been immune to the tariff related uncertainties and geopolitical tensions that have slowed the broader deal market since april but even as some deal processes have stretched out tech investors remain upbeat going into the year s second half the sector has held up better than most through the first half of lifting its share of all

sps discussions earlier this year with  plus private equity tech specialists indicated they remain confident that technology software in particular is less exposed to tariff related impacts than many sectors and the pressure to move assets is only building not since has the backlog of technology companies held longer than four years been higher and dry powder in tech focused funds was sitting at billion globally at the end of there s a growing recognition that raising the next fund will likely depend on freeing up that capital sooner rather than later the shifting value equation amid these shortish term market dynamics however tech investors face a larger more complex question as software markets mature where will the next phase of growth and returns come from many indicators suggest the nature of software investing is undergoing a fundamental shift the easy money era of picking up a promising saas company and watching revenues and multiples explode is drawing to a close future returns will increasingly depend on finding new sources of revenue growth and expanding margins through operational excellence revenue growth in the software sector has outpaced the broader market for so long it s almost taken for granted but as penetration curves in many product areas begin to flatten overall software spending is technology report figure software spending continues to outpace overall gdp growth and expand its share of total output but its relative growth is slowing total sector revenue us trillions software and services revenue software and services revenue as percentage of gdp percentage of us gdp percentage point change in share of gdp note shows base year inflation adjusted dollar values includes exports sources s p global us federal reserve bank easing off too although software continues to expand its share of us gross domestic product gdp its relative growth is starting to ebb see figure the amount of white space available varies by sector but after adopting software at a breakneck pace for years mature segments like retail and manufacturing have deeply embedded software solutions for nearly every workflow not just the standard enterprise resource planning erp or customer relationship crm software but also specialty solutions for specific functions like contract management and employee engagement see figure relative digital laggard sectors like construction may have more room to run but overall growth derived by a company simply showing up in an underserved market will be harder to come by in the years ahead this is not to say that the outlook for software is dimming we know for sure that analysts and pundits have consistently underestimated software growth as the industry continues to innovate and find new use cases and workflows to automate the digital revolution in the workplace is ongoing and will continue to fuel spending at the same time however tapping into that growth and turning it into investment returns will require different capabilities and approaches to value creation the easiest way to see this is to look at how pe funds have generated returns in the past see figure revenue growth has contributed of the total value creation since of that the majority has come from traditional means penetrating new markets and customers upselling existing accounts and eventually raising prices almost as much has come from multiple expansion as booming deal technology report figure software penetration is topping out in major sectors like retail and manufacturing though some sectors like construction offer more room to grow retail manufacturing construction average penetration of average penetration of average penetration of retail specific pos software retail specific pos software construction specific

penetration gains alone gains alone gains alone source historical bain due diligence data markets pushed acquisition prices steadily higher margin improvement meanwhile has contributed just of value in the current interest rate environment the same level of multiple expansion is unlikely and those once reliable revenue producers are losing steam in addition to flattening penetration curves traditional upsell cross sell motions are less effective and like for like pricing increases are harder to sustain amid pressure on customer budgets and heavy competition that means investors will have to not only work harder to find each dollar of top line growth but also build efficient new operations capable of executing on those opportunities profitably top tier firms seeking new revenue sources are focusing on several areas at once displacing competitors this is an imperative in any maturing industry as penetration curves flatten the companies maintaining growth rates are those adept at taking share from weaker competitors and incumbents think fighting for gray space not opening new white space this requires significant investments in new go to market capabilities to better quantify and segment market opportunities these are motions many fast growing software companies haven t had to worry about until now technology report figure tech has outperformed most other sectors for private investors largely because of revenue growth and multiple expansion not margin improvement notes all calculations in usd deal universe includes fully and partially realized north american buyout and growth deals with initial investments made between and excludes real estate source dealedge powered by cepres data tapping ai it s no secret that artificial intelligence is changing the game in many product categories it offers opportunities to both transform legacy products with new functionality and develop new offerings and use cases indeed continued upsell and cross sell will increasingly depend on ai  enabled innovation that requires targeted investment in r d and rapid testing aimed at aligning the success of the software provider with the success of the customer deploying modern pricing models waiting for a product to stick and then tapping incremental seat based price increases is less and less effective innovative commercial organizations are gaining traction with outcome  or value based pricing models founded on the measurable value they deliver to the customer not the number of users provider costs or other traditional factors expanding geographically even if a once hot sector is slowing in the us ample opportunity may exist in another region but successful expansion into new geos requires a disciplined strategy often based on m a capabilities including successful integration and change management new market development and localization of products to adjust to different languages and workflow requirements building in payments capability and or monetizing data especially in vertical software or products aimed at a specific industry customers are increasingly looking for solutions with integrated payments capabilities built in systems that smooth transactions and often capture valuable data that standard point of sale pos systems can t technology report tactics like these give software investors the means to maintain their growth focus but generating top tier returns will increasingly require concerted efforts to boost margins the traditional answer here of course is cost takeout coming in and rationalizing a company s cost structure too often with a heavy hand that can end up being counterproductive a more evolved approach to margin improvement is holistic all costs get a thorough going over but the real value comes from developing an improved strategy based on the right top line considerations and matching it to improvements or investments in go to market capabilities better cost of goods management enhanced processes and a more efficient targeted r d function ai can be an important tool to increase efficiency in all these areas as can a much tighter definition of who your most important customers are and how to serve them commercial excellence is eminently measurable but so is r d surprise with tools like faros ai or jellyfish top tier performers no longer treat the research function as a black box tracking engineering productivity is increasingly critical for fund managers a few key questions can help focus the new imperative for each portfolio company is our go to market approach the right one for future opportunities or is it still calibrated to yesterday s market are r d and product development focused on the innovations that will stand out with today s customers and power the next phase of growth what are the specific future risks and opportunities ai presents for this business how should we prepare right now how can we use m a to supercharge our strategy which opportunities are likely to be accessible is our current talent matched appropriately to the value creation strategy we ll need in the future the opportunity in tech is no less vibrant than it ever was but the best way of capitalizing on it is evolving rapidly what worked so well in the past is unlikely to generate the same level of return in the future it s time to boost your value creation game strategic battlegrounds will agentic ai disrupt saas how can we meet ai s insatiable demand for compute power humanoid robots from demos to deployment quantum computing moves from

glance generative and agentic ai are disrupting software as a service saas by automating tasks and replicating workflows saas leaders can manage the risks by identifying where ai can enhance their offerings and where it might replace them to stay ahead they must own the data lead on standards and price for outcomes not log ons in an ai first world with the right playbook that includes deep ai integration strong data moats and leadership on standards incumbents can shape not just survive the next wave of saas when software as a service saas first emerged years ago it revolutionized software

routine rules based digital task could move from human plus app to ai agent plus application programming interface api saas providers know this strategic problem is urgent but it s also addressable product leaders must answer several strategic questions which user workflows can ai and agents automate to what extent which saas workflows can be handled by ai and agents where will ai increase the size of the software market and where will it cannibalize where are incumbents and new entrants favored what investment priorities will shape the outcome in their favor in our work with clients we see

automate tasks and penetrate workflows to navigate these risks executives should evaluate workflows according to two independent characteristics the potential for ai to automate saas user tasks and the potential for ai to penetrate saas workflows mapping workflows against these characteristics can help identify value at risk and plans to capture it before it migrates elsewhere six indicators can help companies understand the degree to which ai and agents can replace or further assist users task structure and repetition risk of error contextual knowledge dependency data availability and structure process variability and exceptions and human workflow and user interface dependency where these indicators suggest a high potential to automate saas user activity the ai disruption tends to expand the market offering significant opportunity to capture top line growth see figure six additional indicators help identify which saas workflows are most easily replicated and potentially captured by ai and agents external observability industry standardization proprietary data depth switching and network friction regulatory certification barriers and agent protocol maturity the higher a workflow s ai penetration potential the easier it is for a clever ai wrapper to siphon usage and margin see figure four strategic scenarios by plotting products and workflows saas providers can estimate which scenario from figure most resembles the impact of ai this maps out across four strategic scenarios see figure ai enhances saas low user automation low ai penetration these workflows are core strongholds for incumbents these still rely on human judgment and rivals struggle to mimic the logic behind them think of procore s project cost accounting or medidata s clinical trial randomization both require deep domain knowledge strict oversight and regulated data flows incumbents should use ai to boost productivity while protecting the unique data that sets them apart price

standards mcp and a a has shown strong network effect dynamics for instance lightning fast tipping points winner takes most we expect that the standard for this semantic layer will be similar in other words the first semantic layer that creates an industry wide standard to enable an invoice bot to talk to a payment bot for example will reshape the ai ecosystem and direct a large next wave of value

opportunity make ai central to your roadmap look for the key jobs that your software helps users accomplish and deploy ai to automate and speed them up take a customer centric view identify repeatable

into a do it for me experience and help customers see the roi embed ai deeply stay at the center of the workflow and deliver more value turn unique data into your edge your data is your moat while models such as gpt  o are everywhere the real value lies in the proprietary data you own usage patterns domain specific content and transaction history for example double down on capturing and using this data to deliver results no outsider can match and protect it if you connect with other ai platforms make sure your terms stop them from learning from your data and cutting you out the aim become

based pricing may not fit when ai is doing the work if an agent replaces a human task customers will expect to pay based on outcomes not log ons start experimenting with pricing tied to results tasks

understand what ai can and can t do hiring or training the right talent from machine learning engineers to prompt designers and building a culture that s excited about innovation everyone from product

in the end your organization should be as comfortable using ai as a new hire is with a browser write the next chapter before your competitors do ai is disrupting saas creating upsides and downsides by tailoring investments and strategic plans to each workflow s strategic context anchoring to the new platform layers and investing in semantic gaps that affect your developers today s leaders can shape the future not chase it strategic battlegrounds how can we meet ai s insatiable demand for compute power technological innovation new revenue and public support may be needed to fund and supply enough electricity by david crawford michael schallehn paul renno peter hanbury and alessandro cannarsi at a glance ai s computational needs are growing more than twice as fast as moore s law pushing toward gigawatts of new demand in the us by meeting this demand could require billion in annual spending on new data centers but even an aggressive reinvestment of it and ai savings leaves a big gap technological and algorithmic breakthroughs could help but supply chain shortages or insufficient power supply could also thwart progress of all the breathtaking observations about ai few exceed this one the growth rate for ai s compute demand is more than twice the rate of moore s law see figure for decades moore s law that is the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles about every two years has been the unrivaled measure of technological progress if you apply its rate of progress to other fields of endeavor the results are equally mind blowing and amusing for example an automobile technology report figure compute demand grows twice as fast as chip efficiency training compute flop gemini ultra gpt  palm alphago zero gpt  compute demand alphago master growth  x every

floating point operations which are the number of calculations a system performs source epoch ai with moore s law applied would travel at miles per hour achieve million miles per gallon of gas and cost four cents now ai s compute demand that is the number of computations that must be performed to support evolving models has grown at twice that rate over the past decade with continued growth of these models and more adoption of ai by enterprises bain s analysis suggests that the total global compute requirements could reach gigawatts by in the us alone total demand could reach gigawatts by that time which would increase new electricity demand on a grid that has seen relatively flat load growth for the past years what are the implications of this for technology executives charged with allocating capital and managing investments if you bet on continued growth and add lots of power generation or compute capacity while the trend slows down you could be stuck with catastrophic unutilized power and compute capacity if you bet that the trend will slow while it turns out to be durable you may find yourself with insufficient capacity to capture a wave of growth and market share what could change the trajectory as companies form their strategic plans and determine investments they should be considering four critical factors that could either impede or accelerate this growth unaffordable economics better graphics technological breakthroughs and supply chain shortages technology report the economics become unaffordable bain s research suggests that building the data centers with the computing power needed to meet that anticipated demand would require about billion of capital investment each year a staggering sum that far exceeds any anticipated or imagined government subsidies this suggests that the private sector would need to generate enough new revenue to fund the power upgrade how much is that bain s analysis of sustainable ratios of capex to revenue for cloud service providers suggests that billion of annual capex corresponds to trillion in annual revenue what could fund this trillion every year if companies shifted all of their on premise it budgets to cloud and also reinvested the savings anticipated from applying ai in sales marketing customer support and r d estimated at about of those budgets into capital spending on new data centers the amount would still fall billion short of the revenue needed to fund the full investment see figure the algorithms get better when mathematical problems grow too complex or costly step change progress often comes not from incremental tuning but rather from entirely new algorithmic approaches innovations such as mapreduce which popularized distributed data processing and the transformer architecture which unlocked a more efficient way to process sequential data exemplify this kind of breakthrough even at smaller scales algorithmic innovation can unlock meaningful gains in foundation models techniques such as mixed precision matrix computation improve training and inference figure even with ai related savings billion in additional revenue would need to be generated to fund the necessary data centers  t trillion revenue needed for data center construction    b    b billion annual capex needed for building new data centers    b move all on premise applying ai reduces applying ai remaining gap it to the cloud costs of sales marketing saves on to fund new and customer support r d spending data centers by sources oecd s p global bain cloud cio survey idc fortune gartner technology report efficiency logical methods such as chain of thought prompting or large model distillation boost performance while lowering computational load deepseek is a recent example pushing the compute efficiency frontier through smarter algorithmic design still even with these innovations the path forward requires a significant increase in infrastructure to reach the gigawatts of additional compute power that will be needed technological breakthroughs change the landscape history is replete with unexpected leaps of progress in computational power sixty years of moore s law progress in semiconductors has given us handheld devices that far outperform the most powerful computers of the     s many speculate that quantum computing for example could displace the favored semiconductors trajectory of today reducing the compute and power demands of tomorrow s systems bain s research suggests we are at least to years away from quantum computers stable enough to replace generative ai training and inference workloads other technological breakthroughs could include specially designed training and inference application specific integrated circuits asics which could be more efficient than general purpose graphics processing units gpus or new forms of memory or advanced packaging to improve power efficiency bain s research suggests we are at least to years away from quantum computers stable enough to replace generative ai training and inference workloads shortages hit the supply chain it will be difficult to build data centers fast enough to meet rising demand given constraints in four areas power supply construction services compute enablers such as gpus and the limited supply of data center equipment including electrical switchgear and advanced cooling of these increasing the supply of electricity may be the most challenging as bringing new power generation transmission and distribution online in a highly regulated industry can take four years or longer while no single issue will solve this deep challenge innovation government support and efficient markets are all factors that could help close the gap ai has the potential not only to improve productivity but also to spur the development of new businesses and revolutionary technological advancements in areas as diverse as drug discovery autonomous vehicles and logistics such large shifts frequently unlock new value in the economy and they could help produce the revenue needed for the necessary capex however without such innovations or breakthroughs general progress could slow and the field could be left to only those players in markets with adequate public funding strategic battlegrounds humanoid robots from demos to deployment with capabilities evolving rapidly now is the time to begin assessing when and how bipedal robots may change industries by peter hanbury arjun dutt and neil malik at a glance humanoid robotics are drawing capital and headlines but early deployments are mostly limited to highly structured environments tech leaders should look beyond the hype and track capability trajectories intelligence and perception are nearing parity with humans while handling and battery life remain gating factors commercial success will hinge on ecosystem readiness companies that pilot early invest in infrastructure and build workforce trust will be well positioned when the robots are truly ready humanoid robots are having a moment from viral videos to billion dollar valuations the reality behind the headlines is more complex while demonstrations dazzle most deployments remain early stage with heavy reliance on human supervision these robots typically bipedal with dexterous movement advanced sensing and vision and ai powered reasoning drew about billion in venture capital investment in expectations for their deployment are partly driven by demand demographic changes in some advanced economies could lead to labor technology report shortages as working age populations decline by up to for more on the underlying economics read the bain brief humanoid robots at work what executives need to know humanoids along with other types of robots industrial mobile collaborative with humans are part of an expanding automation toolkit to address workforce gaps and productivity challenges for executives navigating automation strategies understanding the real technology trajectory is critical companies making investment decisions need to understand which capabilities are advancing fastest and what realistic adoption timelines look like across industries reality check humanoid robots aren t ready for prime time yet most humanoid robots today remain in pilot phases heavily dependent on human input for navigation dexterity or task switching this autonomy gap is real current demos often mask technical constraints through staged environments or remote supervision lessons from the autonomous vehicle sector suggest a phased approach safe environments first building trust through performance then scaled deployment controlled environments such as industrial portions of retail and select service environments are likely to be where humanoid robots are deployed first places where the layout and environment are well known and closely controlled and where tasks are likely to fall within a limited subset more variable environments with greater potential for direct human interaction such as homes cities or the outdoors will take longer especially given the capability advances that will be needed for true autonomy in unconstrained settings four capabilities will determine progress today core technologies in humanoid robotics remain below human capabilities intelligence and perception however are advancing rapidly and are likely to be the first to reach human level performance see figure intelligence generative ai is advancing rapidly enabling high level reasoning planning and spatial awareness these capabilities are likely to surpass human performance in many tasks within the next two to three years in physical work settings specialized knowledge is often needed raising the bar on what data the robots must be trained on and what situations they must be able to think through perception sensors especially vision are at a similar stage to generative ai catching up with human capabilities powered by advances across lidar and other technologies however vision sensors still lag the human eye in dynamic range particularly in low light conditions and in identifying reflective or transparent objects such as shiny surfaces and clear plastics handling despite advances dexterity and fine motor control are still in relatively earlier stages with real gaps in tactile sensitivity and precision but not all jobs require human level dexterity tasks such as warehouse sorting or tray delivery can be executed with current levels of mechanical reach and technology report grip tasks such as precision manufacturing or lab work will require further advances and potentially significantly higher cost to be addressable power battery performance is improving but slowly most humanoids today operate for only about two hours achieving a full eight hour shift without recharging could take up to years or even longer as energy density improves and costs decline see figure until then operators will need to rely on operational innovations such as swappable batteries and fast charging or limit operations to environments where robots can remain continuously plugged in managing expectations where humanoids will deploy first the most promising short term value for humanoids lies not in general purpose humanoids but in hybrids that combine human like perception with wheeled or static platforms or limited dexterity for example some companies are developing humanoids with a two arm torso on a wheeled base to perform warehouse logistics figure enabling technologies are still coming online with intelligence and perception catching up first time to close gap years well below basic reasoning intelligence surpasses humans but years robot intelligence is still far from autonomous slightly below vision sensors now perception catching up with years human eye performance human level capabilities well below degrees of flexibility approach human level handling years but sensor density and coverage remain well below human well below lithium based batteries are already power available with innovations focused years on incremental improvements in battery density source

the next three years the first commercial applications will come from semi structured tasks such as tote picking palletizing or line feeding inside durable goods factories warehouses and even transportation settings where humanoids can leverage existing automation infrastructure and workflows early deployments will remain in closed environments where traffic is limited and predictable while industrial robots are already common in these sectors there remain many areas where automation is still limited often due to variability or cost making them prime opportunities for humanoid deployment see figure in five years improved dexterity and battery modules will likely support robots move into semi structured service settings where they ll perform tasks such as cleaning and preparing hotel rooms hauling laundry running hospital supplies or shuttling hazardous materials jobs requiring eight hour shifts will likely be enabled with modular battery hot swaps or fast charging safety will remain paramount and use cases will expand into open guest facing areas only as certification and human acceptance thresholds are met within the next decade we expect physical intelligence the ability of autonomous systems such as robots self driving cars and smart spaces to perceive understand and act in the real world to reach cross domain capabilities once that happens and battery power can support a full shift without intervention real open ended use cases will start to emerge in applications as diverse as elder care assistance light construction or materials handling in mining and other remote environments in short capabilities will unfold in waves industrial workflows in controlled environments first variable service environments next and finally the messy open real

safety and certification regimes workforce acceptance and perhaps most important public trust in machines that look and move like us progress on those fronts will ultimately determine how quickly

gabe dunn velu sinha laurent pierre baculard syed ali and willy chang at a glance quantum computing is advancing with up to billion impact possible but full potential isn t guaranteed and may be gradual quantum is poised to augment not replace classical computing each applied where most appropriate to provide solutions cybersecurity is the most pressing concern deploying post quantum cryptography pqc can protect data from decryption in industries where quantum hits first talent gaps and long lead times mean leaders should start planning now over the past two years quantum computing has moved closer to practical real world applications breakthroughs in fidelity error correction and scaling qubits the basic units of quantum computing like the s and s bits in classical computing across platforms signal that it s not a question of if but when technology report investment is following suit tech giants like alphabet ibm and microsoft are doubling down while governments are scaling national quantum strategies and it s not just computing quantum sensing communication and annealing a technique for solving optimization problems are already at work given the early state of commercialization expansive and open minded approaches are critical for the development of specific types of qubits the infrastructure necessary to scale and manage quantum components that will run alongside the host classical systems and algorithms and middleware tools for connecting with data sets and sharing results ibm has taken this broad view developing several generations of quantum related technologies over the past to years the company has generated interest in its quantum computing systems among academic and industrial users in some cases by supporting solution providers as they explore the market but the field remains open no single technology or vendor has pulled ahead and many technical hurdles remain experimentation costs have fallen and companies can now embark on exploring quantum with relatively modest entry costs the opportunities and uncertainties make preparation and agility key quantum s big market potential big but uncertain quantum could unlock as much as billion of market value across industries like pharmaceuticals finance logistics and materials science see figure while the full potential is immense the pace of progress and extent of realization are uncertain and many advances will need to be made beyond qubit scaling to reach full market potential a fully capable fault tolerant computer at scale will be needed and that s still years away at least four major barriers stand in the way hardware maturity quantum computing faces steep technological hurdles before it can reach full potential many having to do with the need to convert or hold information in the fragile quantum state these include physical scaling fidelity and error correction coherence times that is how long a qubit can retain its quantum state quantum memory similarly the ability to store quantum information reliably over time data loading the process of converting traditional data to quantum information and qubit control bottlenecks the ability to manipulate qubits without losing fidelity or picking up cross talk although some might hope for a moore s law relative to qubit scaling the nature of quantum devices and the challenges of scaling here are quite different and their difficulty increases exponentially with qubit count algorithm maturity while quantum computing hardware garners most of the headlines for many use cases practical application will require major advances in quantum algorithms qa research is ongoing and major progress has been made in optimizing existing quantum algorithms but the pace of new qa development has slowed technology report quantum machine learning qml over half the projected market value about billion sits here but it s still mostly theoretical key algorithmic and data loading bottlenecks suggest this could be among the later use cases realized and the applications for the highest value machine learning cases generative ai llms remain even more speculative practical roi many current quantum targets including simulation and optimization are already being tackled with good enough classical computing to justify using quantum computing instead it would need to deliver real sustained performance and cost advantages in places where classical computing approaches fall short even as classical computing continues to advance some expect a single quantum breakthrough but we anticipate more of a gradual curve early wins in narrow domains within five to ten years with broader adoption unfolding over time the market today for quantum computing hardware and services is less than billion a year barring a major breakthrough roadmaps suggest that over the next five to ten years we ll see initial examples of quantum supremacy quantum computers outperforming classical approaches in practical and useful

today s best encryption is real although today s quantum computing can t break state of the art encryption yet some malicious organizations have embarked on a strategy of harvest now decrypt later intending to store sensitive data for five years or more until the evolution of quantum empowers them to break the encryption bain s recent survey on the implications of post quantum cryptography pqc on cybersecurity found that of it security professionals expect this to be a material risk within five years and expect it within three years though some expect it will take longer see figure however

transition isn t easy it requires mapping the company s cryptographic landscape updating protocols and ensuring compliance companies will need to update their it and cyber technology stacks with pqc  enabled solutions for large or legacy heavy organizations this process could take years a future of hybrid solutions quantum computing will not replace classical computing it will complement it becoming an important part of a broad mosaic of solutions quantum computing will play a targeted role solving specific problems where classical systems fall short quantum computing is likely to replace supercomputing tasks in initial applications where it won t compete with high performance data centers as it evolves it s likely to take on a wider range of activity but still in a hybrid fashion where it will work with classical computing to form complete solutions already much of the focus is on developing architectures in which quantum and classical computing work well together quantum computing will play a targeted role solving specific problems where classical systems fall short the future compute stack will be a mosaic with quantum processors alongside cpus gpus and other accelerators optimized for specific functions winning companies will be those who can knit these together into a unified high performing system symmetrically the future of analytics will be a mosaic too with capabilities ranging from simple regressions to ai agentic high performance compute capabilities and quantum algorithms each evolving in complementary fashion and directed at specific business problems mobilize today lead tomorrow for many companies the most pressing need is securing data for a post quantum world in sectors where quantum is likely to have a near term impact developing readiness is more operational than technical that means defining target use cases building capabilities forming partnerships and scanning for signals in a fast moving space working with companies to assess their quantum readiness we ve seen it takes three to four years on average to go from awareness to a structured approach that includes a strategic roadmap an ecosystem of partnerships and pilot programs moving quantum use cases from r d out to business units and technology report functions including the time needed to experiment and climb learning curves can take between six and nine months this reflects the time needed for mathematical modeling algorithm tuning formatting incoming and outgoing data deployment interpretation impact on competitiveness as well as recruiting and training the right people the challenge today is navigating between moving too quickly including overinvesting in a not yet mature technology and moving too slowly which could leave a company struggling to keep pace with competitors most companies are still in the early stages with talent scarce and the learning curve steep those who move now will shape the quantum landscape later operational transformations state of the art of agentic ai transformation ai is transforming productivity but sales remains a new frontier from pilots to payoff generative ai in software development building the foundation for agentic ai operational transformations state of the art of agentic ai transformation tech forward enterprises have cracked the code on roi for ai falling behind is riskier than ever as the next wave of agentic ai raises the stakes by david crawford anne hoecker chuck whitten jue wang aaron lewis and ryan petranovich at a glance ai leaders have moved from pilots to profits delivering to ebitda gains by scaling ai across core workflows falling behind is increasingly risky companies still experimenting should follow the proven playbook for ai transformation agentic ai offers another round of gains but requires more technology for agents to interact and operate across silos the pace of innovation demands pragmatism not purity winners will build momentum with fit  for purpose solutions artificial intelligence continues to surge ahead at an unprecedented pace catapulting some companies forward and leaving others far behind in and tech forward enterprises broke through the pilot phase achieving to ebitda gains by scaling information retrieval and single task ai in doing so they established a repeatable technology report playbook that others can now follow grounded in robust methodology analytic tools and clear benchmarks yet a year on most organizations remain stuck in experimentation mode satisfied with minor productivity gains that haven t delivered significant value but as the leaders move forward falling behind risks ceding competitive ground that may be difficult to recover and things are about to get even more interesting in the first half of major players including anthropic alphabet microsoft openai salesforce and others debuted their visions of agentic ai tech forward enterprises are already turning their focus from automating tasks to redesigning entire workflows early adopters are figuring out how agents will coexist safely discover each other gather the context and data they need and collaborate productively as the vision meets reality they ll also wrestle with data silos informal context intellectual property privacy security and vendor profit motives a purist view of architecture won t meet the moment given the current pace of ai innovation the most likely scenario is that we ll see rapid fitful and hard to predict progress companies should maintain an architectural north star but sustain progress with fit for purpose domain specific and human in the loop builds for the foreseeable future maximizing value demands focused attention on a few key priorities keep up the pace the most important tasks remain redesigning processes and workflows while cleaning up data falling further behind is dangerous follow the taillights of the enterprise leaders the playbook is established with methodology analytic tools and benchmarks available take a principled but flexible view of architecture balance long term vision with flexible domain specific solutions to keep pace with ai s progress leaders cracked the code in our tech report we wrote about how some leaders were beginning to unlock the secrets of ai productivity see you re out of time to wait and see on ai in we could already see clear patterns about where ai roi could reliably be captured see five functions where ai is already delivering while transformation styles varied these early adopters have delivered a roadmap with proven methodology analytic tools and benchmarks we can summarize this roadmap with five critical actions set ambitious goals based on top down diagnostics not trials and pilots charge general managers with meeting these targets not the cio or cto redesign entire workflows not siloed activities or use cases technology report curate and clean the data and application environment as needed not holistically make buy or partner to build capabilities for each major workflow rather than waiting for enterprise  wide solutions the biggest insight from these transformations is that the most important aspects of the transformation are process redesign and cleaning up the data and application environment because of this it doesn t make sense to wait for the dust to settle on technology there s no way to cut corners on process data and application cleanup every day a company waits is another day it s left behind ai leaders pursue agentic ai ai innovation increasingly focuses on enabling models to work with much more complex reasoning context and unstructured data while communicating with saas applications and other agents see figure as noted earlier many tech giants debuted their visions of agentic ai in the first half of while flavors vary the underlying progression of capabilities crystallizes into four levels level llm powered information

workflow execution supervised agents level multi agent constellations e g any to any agent loosely coupled collaborative agents tech forward companies scaled level tools in and with varying degrees of success when deployed in a diffuse way they delivered microproductivity what we might call grab a coffee time savers but when deeply embedded in functional workflows in areas such as sales development and product management the gains compounded especially after heavy data cleaning and curation as well as continuous high quality governance levels and are now where capital innovation and deployment

is transforming productivity but sales remains a new frontier potential applications of generative and agentic ai could free up more selling time and boost conversion rates by ann bosche jue wang peter bowen tamara lewis justin murphy and mark kovac at a glance sales teams have trailed other functions in adopting and benefiting from ai but the potential is too great to ignore ai can handle tasks that free up sellers to spend more time with customers and early successes show or better improvement in win rates as elsewhere the secret to significant gains lies in reimagining sales processes rather than just automating existing ones identifying high potential areas and deciding where to start are important first steps along with securing c level sponsorship over the past two years generative ai has taken center stage with promises to improve productivity by accelerating software development streamlining marketing content enhancing support solutions and reducing administrative burdens despite the enthusiasm most companies haven t unlocked these benefits at scale or seen meaningful gains in cost efficiency or revenue growth technology report now agentic ai is stepping in with self directed agents that can follow a complex workflow set goals plan execute and learn on the fly all with minimal human input the potential smarter systems faster outcomes and more room for people to focus on what really matters but truly successful results remain rare many companies are logging small productivity improvements in a few areas such as software development but only a few can measure their success in double digits but truly successful results remain rare many companies are logging small productivity improvements in a few areas such as software development but only a few can measure their success in double digits that s because most companies haven t cracked the formula yet on implementing ai at scale and sales represents a more difficult challenge than most activities for a handful of reasons one use case rarely moves the needle because a seller s day is fragmented across dozens of tasks most companies haven t stepped back to map the end to end selling journey so efforts remain piecemeal bottom up experimentation doesn t work because the objectives are inherently unclear applying ai to existing processes often results in only small productivity gains micro  productivity because new bottlenecks emerge without process redesign companies end up automating inefficiencies instead of removing them ai needs massive data context and cleanliness but sales and go to market data are spread across many systems with little quality control or governance sales teams are stretched and distracted and this is one more tool in a long parade of tech promises unlike functions such as engineering in which workflows are relatively standardized sales processes vary wildly by team region and individual frontline teams are often reluctant to change their behavior making quota is seen as good enough and ai training is typically static the upside however is too promising to ignore sellers may spend only about of their time actually selling to customers ai could double that by taking on much of the work that surrounds selling but doesn t add much value leaving more time for customer service see figure and that s only half the technology report figure ai could free up more selling time and boost conversion rates selling non selling seller time hours per week less time processing simple and repeat orders working in the tools sitting in internal meetings performing administrative tasks more time acquiring accounts and expanding lines of business negotiating and developing solutions for complex needs building relationships baseline ambition source bain company picture ai also helps teams improve conversion rates at every step in the selling funnel step change improvements that add up to more than a increase in win rates mapping ai across the sales life cycle sales teams looking at this potential from ai need to determine where ai can deliver the biggest gains and where to start bain s work with business to business and business to consumer technology and consumer companies deploying ai in sales has identified use cases across the various steps in the sales life cycle that leaders should explore to capture maximum benefits from deploying ai see figure some of these started as more traditional software automation and were enhanced by ai machine learning many of them have been further enhanced by generative ai and now we re seeing agentic ai deployed in several use cases realizing agentic ai s potential the deployment of agentic ai promises to unlock even more value in sales the technology is moving quickly but most companies are still crawling vendors are likely to deliver more capable applications over the next to months but already we re seeing targeted results at scale for example among companies using no code workflows see figure the biggest hurdles remain cleaning the data standardizing the process making difficult governance decisions and changing the way work gets done which must include shutting down the old ways of working as well as access to old tools data technology report figure  a across the sales life cycle use cases are good candidates for ai sales life cycle prospecting and

progress delivered by ai over the past few years source bain company identifying where to get started many companies struggle with where to begin given the wide range of viable ai applications the domains in figure illustrate use cases that are often interdependent making it hard to move forward without first addressing foundational elements such as data architecture and business alignment take lead generation and prospecting without clean connected data sellers don t know why an account is hot who to engage what to pitch or how to tailor the message while many firms jump ahead to guided selling reps first need insights that are trustworthy easy to act on and genuinely new the most effective pilots focus on one or two domains at the front end of the sales life cycle in which sellers need the most help identifying informing and acting on leads leading companies build from there prioritizing use cases based on business value and process readiness that approach lays the groundwork for lasting gains in sales efficiency stronger customer engagement and seller confidence in ai tools technology report landing the full potential of ai in sales in our work helping companies experiment with ai in sales we ve seen a consistent set of lessons emerge that separate the pilots that fizzle from those that scale adopt an end to end view of a process generative or agentic ai may be the headline but the real value lies in the combination of agentic and generative ai with traditional ai and automation process redesign data cleanup top down target setting and focus of execution reimagine processes automating mediocre processes only accelerates mediocre outcomes rethink selling activities and develop best practice workflows narrow the scope to scale trying to do everything at once slows momentum start with high  impact slices of the sales process for example one or two domains out of the six in figure and build a roadmap that reflects your commercial motion focus on the data with a bias toward speed over perfection data matters but perfection isn t required focus on what s good enough to move fast and what s needed to clean up the data to reach that point the first step is eliminating old inaccurate or confusing data and content sometimes as much as it takes time and resources don t underinvest here test learn iterate rapid proofs of concept are your best tool to identify where value exists they also build conviction around the vision and the steps to get there c level sponsorship and execution solid change management is table stakes a true ai transformation will also require sustained focus from the executive suite a dedicated implementation team with real capabilities should be given accountability for setting targets and reaching goals ai has huge potential to transform sales but most companies aren t seeing meaningful results yet to turn promise into performance teams need to identify and prioritize high value use cases reimagine critical processes and clean up their data it all hinges on a clear top down commitment to deploy ai at scale when done right leaders can dramatically improve life for frontline sellers and build a durable edge over competitors still stuck in wait and see mode operational transformations from pilots to payoff generative ai in software development ai tools improve productivity but process changes are necessary to generate real value by purna doddapaneni bill radzevych steven breeden bharat bansal and tanvee rao at a glance software coding was one of the first areas to deploy generative ai but the savings have been unremarkable real gains come from applying ai across the software life cycle not just code but product requirements planning test and maintenance redesigning processes and applying time saved to other work are among the best ways to improve returns on ai investments the next wave of autonomous agents raises the stakes allowing companies to redesign entire workflows to gain a competitive edge generative ai arrived on the scene with sky high expectations and many companies rushed into pilot projects yet the results haven t lived up to the hype two out of three software firms have rolled out generative ai tools and among those developer adoption is low teams using ai assistants see to productivity boosts but often the time saved isn t redirected toward higher value work so even those technology report modest gains don t translate into positive returns without a plan to turn interest into habit initial gains quickly evaporate leaving leaders asking where s the payoff beyond code completion generative ai for the entire life cycle early initiatives often fixate on code generation that is using generative ai to write code faster but writing and testing code only accounts for about to of the time from initial idea to product launch see figure speeding up these steps does little to reduce time to market if others remain bottlenecked real value comes from applying generative ai across the entire software development life cycle not just coding nearly every phase can benefit from the earlier discovery and requirements stages through planning and design to testing deployment and maintenance broad adoption however requires process changes if ai speeds up coding then code review integration and release must speed up as well to avoid bottlenecks leading companies such as netflix recognized this and shifted testing and quality checks earlier the shifting left approach to ensure that rapidly generated code isn t stuck waiting on slow tests so far generative ai has served as a smart assistant a copilot with a human in control agentic ai will usher in a more autonomous wave namely agents that can manage multiple steps of development with little to no human intervention for example start up cognition introduced an ai software engineer named devin in that can build and troubleshoot applications from natural language prompts figure ai coding assistants may be able to take on as much as of the work that coders do partially or fully addressable with coding assistants collaboration mentorship performance review auxiliary engineering administrative tasks activities problem identification and product feature discovery problem identification design tasks requirement product requirement gathering gathering scoping researching and solutioning code rework bug fixing rework launch maintenance maintenance and production support code development review merge development test code testing and validation time spent by activity note industry experience is based on software as a service developer team surveys with developer teams ranging from around to full time equivalent employees source bain company technology report how leaders scale generative ai leading adopters treat generative ai as a fundamental transformation of their software development life cycle rather than a one off project they take a future back approach to rearchitect their end to end software development life cycle around generative ai embedding it deeply into workflows and scaling it enterprise wide they weave it into development workflows and scale it across use cases leading adopters treat generative ai as a fundamental transformation of their software development life cycle rather than a one off project goldman sachs for example integrated generative ai into its internal development platform and fine  tuned it on the bank s internal codebase and project documentation this gives engineers context aware real time coding solutions far beyond basic autocompletion extending to automated code generation and even code testing thereby significantly accelerating development cycles and boosting programmer productivity these leaders also make sure that generative ai s benefits translate into business value they measure how much time ai saves and redirect that capacity to high value work ensuring that efficiency gains become business gains they also modernize their environments adopting cloud development environments automated continuous integration and delivery pipelines and modular architectures to remove friction that could limit ai s impact they also recognize that there s no one size fits all approach and tailor targeted tools playbooks and trainings to each team s unique needs ensuring smooth fast adoption across diverse scenarios common roadblocks to scaling generative ai even with generative ai s promise many firms are stuck in pilot mode because of some common obstacles lack of executive direction if senior leadership doesn t clearly prioritize generative ai pilot efforts tend to fizzle adoption resistance under pressure developers often fall back on old habits some engineers distrust ai or worry that it will undermine their role three of four companies say that the hardest part is getting people to change how they work overcoming this resistance requires strong change management technology report skills gaps generative ai requires new skills such as writing prompts and reviewing ai output but many firms haven t provided adequate training so even powerful tools go underused no roi tracking it s tough to prove generative ai s value without clear key performance indicators or plans for using the time saved if you don t measure results even real productivity gains won t show up in business terms process or tooling mismatch slow manual processes in build testing or release will choke generative ai s benefits legacy toolchains that can t handle ai generated code will also blunt any speed gains these issues explain why so many ai efforts never get out of the sandbox the good news is that none of these barriers are insurmountable each can be overcome with the right approach often the toughest obstacles are people related so overcoming them requires significant investment in training communication and cultural change reimagine the software life cycle with ai at its core to break out of pilot mode and get real returns from generative ai tech leaders must go beyond incremental tool adoption and frame their roadmap as an ai native reinvention of the software development life cycle starting with a vision of a future in which ai is seamlessly integrated into every phase of development allows teams to then plan backward to make that vision a reality leaders follow a roadmap to move from experimentation to scaled impact set an ai native vision anchored in business outcomes not just tech metrics define a bold future back ambition for how software will be built with ai at the core tie that directly to concrete business outcomes such as faster release cycles lower defect rates or higher customer satisfaction and show where ai is generating real value see figure turn saved time into business results don t let productivity gains sit idle decide early how to use freed up capacity for instance whether to ship more features or reduce spending or accelerate innovation and tie those outcomes to financial impact scale successful practices across teams to maximize roi start with high impact easy wins aligned with the future vision apply generative ai where it can succeed quickly for example generating new feature code or automating tests and help pave the way toward an ai native end state avoid fragile legacy systems at first instead focus on domains that are ready for ai early wins build momentum for broader use cultivate ai native talent and culture provide hands on training such as prompt engineering or ai orchestration workshops and actively manage the culture shift make upskilling a continuous effort reassure engineers that ai is an assistant not a replacement and celebrate early wins to build buy in technology report figure key performance indicators and performance targets measure progress note example is illustrative actual metrics will vary across industries source bain company technology report modernize processes and architecture for ai at scale a true ai native approach often demands overhauling your development environment end to end eliminate process bottlenecks that could reduce ai s speed advantage adjust workflows so that faster coding leads to faster releases and isn t stuck in slow pipelines update development tools to handle ai outputs smoothly prepare for autonomous workflows finally as generative ai evolves from copilot to autonomous agent start experimenting with ai handling end to end development tasks developers roles may shift to guiding these agents as intent engineers or ai orchestrators assign an agent to build a simple app in a sandbox with humans stepping in only if needed these trials will show how far ai can go where oversight is essential and what skills or workflows need to evolve thus signaling your intent to lead in the next wave of development closing the gap from experimentation to execution generative ai s promise is real but capturing it requires moving beyond one off pilots it takes bold leadership to drive adoption revamped processes to embed ai at every step and a focus on measurable outcomes to analyze results and make adjustments the winners won t be those dabbling in flashy demos but rather those redesigning their workflows to fully integrate ai and deliver tangible improvements already some companies report to productivity boosts by pairing generative ai with end to end process transformation far above the gains from basic code assistants experiments pay off only when backed by a well defined approach that converts innovation into measurable results an even bigger leap is on the horizon as ai evolves from assistant to autonomous agent a shift that could redefine software development and widen the gap between firms that treat ai as a novelty and those that embrace it as transformative generative ai s capabilities are steadily broadening and the gains seen today are expected to continue growing over the next to months as models improve their performance and reliability tech executives must excel at implementing generative ai today while also preparing their teams for a more ai driven development model tomorrow experiments pay off only when backed by a well defined approach that converts innovation into measurable results now is the time to act organizations that move decisively with a clear vision and bold execution will capture real returns and redefine how software is built those that hesitate risk being left behind operational transformations building the foundation for agentic ai capturing the full potential of agents will require modernizing enterprise architecture by pascal gautheron chris bell and stephen hardy at a glance agentic ai is a structural shift in enterprise tech reshaping companies with agents that can reason coordinate and execute complex workflows most companies aren t ready capturing full value requires rethinking systems data and governance to support scalable safe agent deployment tech leaders should continue to modernize core platforms while prioritizing interoperability security and accountability early movers are focusing their investments on the most valuable areas building foundational capabilities and using agents in the transformation agentic ai isn t just another wave of automation it s a structural shift in enterprise technology one with the potential to completely redefine how work gets done previous waves of automation tackled parts of processes leaving exceptions where humans had to step in ai agents can reason collaborate and coordinate actions allowing them to accomplish complex multistep nondeterministic processes that have so far depended on humans technology report it s easy to see the transformative potential of this from improved operational efficiency and customer experience to sharper decision making and beyond forward looking leaders aren t asking if agentic ai will reshape their business but how to prepare their organizations to deploy it safely and effectively as executives reflect on how agentic ai might shape their business from competitive positioning to their talent model they will have to consider how it challenges the fundamentals of their it architecture agentic ai architecture builds on the rise of composable microservices architecture and the use of enterprise cloud services that many companies have already been investing in but to fully capture the value while navigating the risks they will need to rethink how ai is embedded across the architecture the systems processes and governance enterprises need to ensure agents have the context they need in real time the ability to observe and explain behavior and the guardrails to execute safely securely and cost effectively current architectures simply cannot handle this balance when ai agents are used in the thousands across the enterprise yet architecture adapts to support agentic ai agentic ai should complement rather than take over the existing architecture tech teams will need to deploy it thoughtfully with clear scope and controls in place agents are best for complex nondeterministic problems that span multiple business domains and systems rely on unstructured data and contextual reasoning depend on real time inputs and until now have required human intervention agentic ai should complement rather than take over the existing architecture tech teams will need to deploy it thoughtfully with clear scope and controls in place higher level orchestrator agents are like project managers that oversee a whole process breaking it down into subtasks and tracking progress task agents execute individual tasks and send back the results to the orchestrator the orchestrator then compiles results and adjusts workflows as needed teams updating the it architecture should consider several key principles as they evolve the design to support an agentic framework see figure modernize the core platform to fully realize the potential of agentic ai many organizations will need to modernize their technology foundations this means making core business capabilities easy for agents to find and use in real time achieving this may require reworking older batch based systems to be more flexible accessible by apis and able to respond to real time events adopting modular industry standard frameworks like the banking industry architecture network will help accelerate this shift however technology report figure updating the it architecture for agentic ai requires special attention to several facets sdlc devops experience engagement knowledge core services enterprise support governance risk compliance agentic ai services integration services data services security services infrastructure services engineering services accelerate modernization of enterprise technology platforms to ensure prioritize new agentic ai integration security capabilities that support observability and enterprise wide life cycle discoverability across management of agents the organization business domains should own capabilities requiring specialized knowledge and deploy their capabilities across the life cycle build test deploy maintain for data products tools and agents within their domain update core enabling capabilities to ensure safe scalable and responsible ai adoption performance management and metrics sdlc devops source bain company technology report these modern systems will need to work alongside existing infrastructure for the foreseeable future which could add some architectural complexity in the near term ensure interoperability of agentic services as agents roll out across the tech stack consistent interoperability standards such as the model context protocol mcp and frictionless integrations will be critical for breaking down silos and capturing the full value of agentic ai most organizations will need to support a mix of frameworks these will include custom agents built on engineering tools prebuilt agents embedded in vendor platforms and dynamically generated agents in data platforms frameworks are themselves becoming more agentic for example a software development life cycle sdlc agent could coordinate a team of specialized agents design analyst engineer quality assurance that collaborate to deliver a complete solution from concept to deployment distribute accountability while central platform teams will control the core agentic platforms accountability for assembling training testing deploying and monitoring agents needs to be distributed to business domains success will hinge on making domain expertise and knowledge assets such as product documentation business logic feature stores models and data products readily discoverable and accessible to agents agentic ai isn t just another wave of automation it s a structural shift in enterprise technology one with the potential to completely redefine how work gets done scale data access scalable access to structured and unstructured data is essential most organizations still lack the required ingestion pipelines for unstructured sources such as documents emails voice recordings images videos and call transcripts these data sources are critical for agentic reasoning especially in manual or exception driven processes where necessary knowledge often resides outside core systems of record or even outside the organization for example one european bank built foundational infrastructure to consistently use both structured and unstructured data to create a holistic view of each customer enabling it to automate and personalize its engagement marketing driving smarter more targeted interactions at scale update governance and controls as agents take on more decision making governance and controls must evolve real time explainability behavioral observability and adaptive security are essential to mitigate risk maintain customer trust and avoid regulatory or reputational fallout at the same time organizations must manage the volatility of compute costs through dynamic resource allocation edge deployment strategies and ai native financial operations practices technology report shift the engineering paradigm software engineering and devops processes both tooling and workflows need to evolve to manage the full life cycle of ai agents including how they are tested monitored and safely deployed as they learn and adapt over time ai agents are also poised to transform how engineering teams operate taking on more of the day to day development testing deployment and system operations this shift will free up engineers to focus on higher value work like architecture strategy and innovation reimagine agent experience and access in this new framework agents become first class channels and citizens as channels they are emerging as primary interfaces for interacting with customers and employees on par with websites mobile apps and call centers as citizens they are fully embedded participants in business operations empowered to act make decisions and collaborate across systems this demands a reimagining of experience design conversational interfaces will dominate human engagement while agent to agent coordination will drive autonomous action across workflows systems and even organizational boundaries to make this work at scale and safely enterprises must establish robust frameworks for identity consent and fine grained access control for example a south american bank that uses agents to facilitate real time pix payments through whatsapp allows customers to simply send a photo or text describing the payment they want to make the ai agent interprets the request identifies the appropriate payment confirms it with the customer and then authorizes and sends the payment all within a conversational experience the implementation imperative over the next three to five years to of technology spending could be directed toward building foundational capabilities including agent platforms communication protocols real time data access and discoverability for agents and modern security and observability frameworks over time investment in agentic ai will grow up to half of technology spending could be on agents running across the enterprise to support business domains over time investment in agentic ai will grow up to half of technology spending could be on agents running across the enterprise to support business domains still the long term economics are favorable as efficiency and process improvements will outweigh the costs investments will need to be tightly focused with an emphasis on delivering value quickly to ensure buy in from the business frameworks for successful transformations typically follow a pattern of four motions technology report focus on a few business domains to generate early value rather than just building capabilities reimagining processes from end to end accelerates returns lowers cost per agent and lays the groundwork for scalable enterprise wide adoption evaluate current architecture for agentic readiness identifying the capabilities required to scale this includes laying the groundwork for agent development toolchains enabling seamless system interoperability and fast tracking the modernization of vector databases event architectures and core infrastructure define and embed observability security governance and controls providing traceability accountability anomaly detection and cost discipline for agentic ai to scale safely across the enterprise these guardrails must be built in from the start not bolted on later use agentic ai in the transformation to reduce effort control costs and ensure outcomes delivering value early helps fund the rest of an agentic transformation companies that don t want to fall behind should be preparing and investing now hiring and upskilling teams embedding new capabilities and understanding the necessary architectural changes those that wait will struggle to catch up agentic ai is already reshaping the enterprise and only those that move decisively
