agentic ai a strategic overhaul of workflows governance roles and investment conclusion appendix introduction executives have long relied on simple categories to frame how technology fits into organizations tools automate tasks people make decisions and strategy determines how the two work together that framing is no longer sufficient a new class of sys  tems agentic ai complicates these boundaries these systems can plan act and learn on their own they are not just tools to be operated or assistants waiting for instructions increasingly they behave like autonomous teammates capable of exe  cuting multistep processes and adapting as they go notably of respondents to our global executive survey say they view agentic ai as more like a coworker than a tool for strategists agentic ai s dual nature as both a tool and coworker creates new dilemmas a single agent might take over a routine step support a human expert with analysis and collaborate across workflows in ways that shift decision making authority this tool coworker duality breaks down traditional management logic which assumes that technology either substitutes or complements auto  mates or augments is labor or capital or is a tool or a worker but not all at once organizations now face an unprecedented challenge managing a single system that demands both human resource approaches and asset management techniques the separation of technology and strategy inside most organizations exacerbates this challenge technology executives focus on technology issues making pilot vendor or infrastructure decisions strategic executives focus on markets competition and people but agentic ai makes that separation untenable it simultaneously influences the design of processes the structure of roles the allocation of decision rights and the culture of accountability about the research this report presents findings from the ninth annual global research study on artificial intelligence and business strategy by mit sloan management review and boston consulting group in spring we fielded a global survey and subsequently analyzed records from respondents representing more than industries and countries we also interviewed executives leading ai initiatives in a broad range of companies and industries including financial services technology retail energy and health care our research examines the speed of agentic ai adoption inside organizations which has outpaced the adoption of traditional and generative ai exploring how agentic ai relates to capital and labor this report outlines a series of resultant tensions and offers suggestions for organizations seeking to resolve them the emerging agentic enterprise how leaders must navigate a new age of ai mit sloan management review bcg a tidal wave of adoption a trickle of strategy despite the technology s wide ranging implications organizations are rapidly adopting agentic ai well before they have a strategy in place their adoption of traditional ai has climbed to over the past eight years accord  ing to our survey see figure generative ai achieved adoption in just three years in just two years agentic ai has already reached adoption with another of organizations planning to deploy it soon vendors are accelerating this trend by embedding agentic capabilities as features in their offerings causing organizations to imple  ment agentic ai before they have developed a strategic management framework the result is a growing strategic risk agentic ai is spread  ing across enterprises faster than leaders can redesign processes assign decision rights or rethink workforce ia gnisu snoitazinagro fo egatnecrep models our research based on  plus respondents to a global survey and interviews with leading executives finds that organizations have multiple options for obtain  ing value from agentic ai it offers possibilities not only to improve cost efficiency but also to expand revenue accelerate innovation compress learning curves and restructure organizations without a strategic approach that aligns these objectives organizations risk limiting returns on their investments the executive dilemma agentic ai s dual nature as both a tool and coworker creates competing organizational pressures that man  agement frameworks cannot resolve it leaders want predictable scalable systems with clear technical

mer head of generative ai machine learning and analytics the right set of controls in place we re calling it human  at truist bank says if you look at the financial services in the loop or human out of the loop for some of our industry i don t think there is any use case that is actually low risk use cases the decision to move to human out  the emerging agentic enterprise how leaders must navigate a new age of ai of the loop for lower risk use cases involves context  dependent assessments of risk unlike a simple tool with a fixed function agentic ai operates within a complex environment where its actions can have unintended conse  quences that means organizations must craft policies that set boundaries for decision making and action to serve as safeguards so that organizational behaviors align with strategic objectives and negative outcomes are prevented this is analogous to setting policies and providing over  sight for human employees sun at sap describes building a generative ai hub for this purpose through that we can then connect to different large language models but we also have the ability then to put in the guardrails for all the business applications we can put in our own analytics we can put in our own security our privacy our compli  ance and so on the need for these controls highlights the fact that ai is not a fully predictable tool but an agent that managers must guide and constrain when a tool malfunctions it s a defect when a coworker makes a mistake it s a management and learning oppor  tunity managers can apply this coworker mindset to ai rebecca finlay ceo at the partnership on ai argues that companies need to be more transparent about their ai failures i would love for us to be in a position where we could share more about things that go wrong because in that sharing we learn this approach treats ai not as an infallible tool but as an agent whose errors must be under  stood managed and learned from the learning process parallels how effective teams handle human error the threat organizations that fail to develop appropriate governance frameworks for agentic ai may face compli  ance failures misaligned outputs or runaway systems that damage business operations the opportunity companies that master the art of man  aging artificial colleagues can scale specialized capabilities without the traditional constraints of human hiring train  ing and retention the scope tension retrofit versus reengineer agentic ai presents leaders with a critical resource allocation choice now complicated by the rapid pace of technological change the decision is whether to retrofit ai into existing workflows for quick incremental gains or to reengineer processes for more transformative but slower results mit sloan management review bcg retrofitting often requires less time and capital delivering the threat organizations that limit agentic ai to incre  faster returns with current technology reengineering in mental improvements may miss transformative opportu  contrast demands a significant commitment of resources nities yet a larger redesign can take considerable resources over a longer

leaders are managing a new entity with  a unified framework agentic ai elevates human judgment out historical precedent it is a tool that learns a worker rather than eliminating it strategic oversight ethical gov  that is owned and an investment that behaves like both ernance and the ability to orchestrate human ai teams tool and worker agentic ai does not fit neatly within become the most critical human skills as ai agents handle the substitute or complement framework because it tasks previously performed by human workers the organi  demands to be managed as both a worker and a tool at zations that thrive will be those that focus less on the tech  once the substitute complement framework asks is ai nology itself and more on the human systems that surround replacing coworkers or augmenting them but agentic ai it this forces a deeply unsettling question for today s leaders forces a more unsettling question how do we manage are we simply adding a new tool to our business or are we artificial colleagues that we own like equipment but must introducing a new nonhuman actor into our organization supervise like people and that depreciate like machinery how we respond will define the next era of management but learn like humans this new technology creates crit  ical design challenges companies beginning to use agentic ai are already grap  pling with that question some are treating it primarily as a way to reduce costs whereas others are using it to expand capacity speed up experimentation or elevate the baseline performance of their people leaders need to be explicit about what they are optimizing for and design their pro  cesses structures and governance accordingly treating an agentic ai deployment like a traditional tool misses its flexibility advantages but treating it like a newly hired staff member underestimates the infrastructure requirements this dual risk creates unavoidable tensions between flexibility and efficiency control and autonomy and upfront investment and continuous learning success will be defined not by eliminating these conflicts but by mastering them the challenge of agentic ai is organizational not techno  logical many organizations are adopting this technology at a breakneck pace often before they have a coherent strat  egy in place but the speed of adoption is not a measure of progress advantage will not come from having the best ai injected into the organization as quickly as possible but from having the best answer to the question how do we reorganize our organization around it the adopt now strategize later approach is a high stakes gamble that avoids the hard work of identifying a purpose for agentic ai that fits well with the organization s strategy ultimately this challenge is deeply human and requires that businesses break down organizational silos the era of managing technology solely within the it department is over governance is now a mandatory cross functional effort where it hr finance and
